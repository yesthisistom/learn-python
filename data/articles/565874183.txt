For some, Thanksgiving means a perfectly trimmed turkey, piles of mashed potatoes and beautiful pumpkin pies. For others it means travel. Lots and lots of travel.

If you're one of the millions of Americans with hours of traffic on the interstate or on a plane in your future, this list is our gift to you. It should keep you entertained through about four hours of holiday travel turmoil. To make it easy for you to relax and just listen, you can click to hear the entire playlist in our mobile app, NPR One. Or, pick the podcast episodes that most interest you from the list below and listen on NPR One or wherever you get your podcasts.

We hope this helps stave off boredom, road rage and utterances of "are we there yet?"
