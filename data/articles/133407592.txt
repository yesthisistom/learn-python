Since the summer of 2009, Scott Hensley has been writing posts and editing them for Shots. Before joining NPR, he was the founding editor of The Wall Street Journal's Health Blog.

He wasn't always in the blogging racket, though. For years he covered the pharmaceutical industry for the Journal and wrote an online column about the business of health. Earlier in his journalism career he was a reporter for trade pubs Modern Healthcare and American Banker.

Longer ago than he'd care to admit, he oversaw clinical trials for high-tech medical devices in the hope of getting them approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Most of the time the machines worked.
