For those of us at NPR, 2016 was chock-full of big news stories, so much so, it sometimes seemed the horrors in the headlines would never stop — the migrant crisis, police shootings, terrorist attacks, and on and on. But when we looked at stories that you, our NPR One listeners, loved listening to the most in 2016, it painted a very different picture of the year.

The highest-rated stories in NPR One indicate that you are passionate about three subjects. First, you love science and innovation. You really love the National Park Service; for its 100th birthday, NPR produced a series of stories throughout the year that captured your attention. And you also enjoyed our longer, sit-down discussions with artists such as Miguel and Dua Lipa, who talked about their creative processes.

Oh, and you also love stories about Finnish mail carriers. (More on that later.)

First, a little bit about how we came up with this list. Our NPR One app allows you to customize your NPR experience, by skipping ahead to the stories you like or to your favorite podcasts. When you listen to a story instead of skipping it and either share that story or tap on that story's light bulb icon (it's our version of the "like" button), it's a pretty good indicator you enjoyed or appreciated that story. These are the 10 stories that had the most of these positive interactions.
