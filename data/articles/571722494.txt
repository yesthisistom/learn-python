At NPR, we know there's a difference between the news that you listen to, and the stories you love.

This year, there was a lot of news that grabbed your attention: several major hurricanes; a new president in office who is ripping up the conventions of Washington; and terrorist attacks both at home and abroad. But we also reported on stories that help us understand how to make our lives better and what makes us human beings tick. The former types of stories we feel we need to know about, the latter we enjoy knowing about.

We can track your favorites by what you tell us as you're listening. Our NPR One app allows listeners to mark stories as interesting, or share them. We also can see how long you spend with a story. (See details on our algorithm.) That means we can rate NPR's top audio stories based on so-called "listening rates" and also by "love rates." We collect this data to learn about how to present our stories more effectively.

This year you responded positively to stories that helped make your life better and to stories that helped you understand issues that aren't always apparent â€” such as the effects of housing laws and the words we use.

Listen on NPR One

We heard a lot about "fake news" this year. At first, that term referred to news stories that were entirely made up. But then President Trump started calling actual news stories he didn't like "fake news." According to language experts on both sides of the aisle, this new use of the phrase "fake news" could be a genuine threat to democracy.

When we look at the stories that did the best job of holding our listeners' attention, it is clear that there was an insatiable appetite for stories that help us understand the big twists and turns of politics in the Trump era.
