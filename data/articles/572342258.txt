At NPR One, we've spent all month making our podcast wish list, checking it a few times, making sure it includes the podcast episodes that have entertained, educated and delighted us and our listeners this year.

So, our gift to you this holiday season is a list full of podcasts to keep you from getting bored while you sit in traffic, on a plane (or in a sled), headed to grandma's. You can hear the whole list in order here, or listen to individual episodes on NPR One or wherever you get podcasts.

Be honest, how long has going to space been on your wish list? NPR's Planet Money team actually fulfills this dream, with their very own satellite. Be there for takeoff and find out why it's becoming so much easier to leave this planet in the first episode of the series.
