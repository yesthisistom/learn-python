"International influence campaigns have been around for centuries, but 2017 made clear how much they remain a part of daily life.

Through court documents, congressional testimony, press reports and other sources, Americans learned not only about the extent of the ""active measures"" — as they're known to intelligence officers — that Russia waged against the U.S. through the presidential election.

They also learned to expect high-tech agitation as part of their normal diet of information online: about the Alabama special election. About the NFL players' protests. About the the violent protests in Charlottesville, Va.

With each of those stories and more, Russian social media accounts were in the mix, turning up the volume by repeating posts, spreading hashtags and seeking as much strife as possible.

""They were taking both sides of the argument this past weekend and pushing them out from their troll farms as much as they could to just raise the noise level in America and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they're trying to push divisiveness in the country,"" as Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in the fall.

He was describing the national debate over NFL players' decision to take a knee during ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" but the practice he described has been repeated in other cases before and since.

Tools such as the German Marshall Fund's ""Hamilton 68"" dashboard track Russian-linked accounts in real time to show what links, phrases and hashtags are circulating. On a typical day, it's a mix of the normal traffic — perennials such as #ThursdayThoughts — and whatever is hot at the moment.

Often, the themes or stories are American — whatever is trending. Although ""fake news"" remains an issue, as well as the use of fake groups or fake accounts, influence-mongers use much of their bandwidth to increase the circulation of issues that are already in the mainstream.

And ""active measures"" don't just target the United States. They also were waged against European targets, including France's election in May and Germany's election in September. Britons confirmed later in the year that Russian active measures had targeted their referendum in 2016 over leaving the European Union.

""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said in remarks addressed to Moscow. ""You underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies, and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us.""

The Trump administration detailed the threat — without any specific mention of the 2016 interference — in the new National Security Strategy it released at the end of December.

""Today, cyberspace offers state and non-state actors the ability to wage campaigns against American political, economic and security interests without ever physically crossing our borders,"" it said.

President Trump himself was generally quieter on the subject.

Trump goes back and forth in his public remarks as to whether he accepts that Russia attacked the 2016 election; sometimes he acknowledges it, other times he calls the story a ""hoax."" After an in-person meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Asia, Trump told reporters he believed Putin was sincere in his denials about the interference measures.

That was after Trump put himself on record — in writing, anyway — condemning foreign interference in U.S. elections.

Boxed in by a veto-proof congressional majority, Trump signed a bill in August that strengthened U.S. sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its election interference.

""I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization,"" he wrote in a statement that accompanied the final law.

All the same, a Washington Post report quoted intelligence officials who say they don't bring up the Russian attack on the election with Trump because it makes him upset.

Trump denies his camp worked with any of the Russians running their broad campaign against the U.S., which included clandestine outreach by human agents and overt messaging by fake accounts that millions of Americans saw on Facebook or Twitter.

The Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, and congressional investigators are all looking into that question.

Until Congress or Mueller is finished — or both — more action doesn't appear in the works to counter the Russian active measures. For one reason, as the Post report described, the administration is divided within itself. There is no consensus between the White House, Pentagon, State Department or intelligence community about what countermeasures to attempt.

Another reason is that even if Washington did reach some consensus, there has never been an appealing menu of options for American policymakers. Active measures campaigns between East and West go back deep to the Cold War, including mischief by the then-Soviet KGB aimed at interfering with the presidential election of 1988.

One of the big unanswered questions about Russia's active measures campaign is about how much forged or uncertain material is circulating in public or confidentially within the U.S. government.

In at least one high-profile case, then-FBI Director James Comey obtained a purported Russian intelligence document describing an outreach by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016, promising to go easy on Clinton over her private email server.

Comey knew the material was unreliable and decided on his own to take matters into his own hands, and away from Lynch, in ultimately deciding not to prosecute Clinton over the emails. Comey declined to publicly answer questions from members of Congress about the document.

His decisions and the environment inside the FBI have come under intense scrutiny by Republican allies of Trump, who've cited evidence uncovered by the Justice Department's inspector general that they say shows some of the officials involved with the case were biased against Trump.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein says the Justice Department's IG will release its report about the Clinton case sometime in early 2018.

That document might include more public detail about the Lynch-Clinton document or perhaps other fraudulent documents that were part of another aspect of the active measures campaign — one aimed not at the general public, but a tiny, elite audience of top U.S. intelligence and national security officials.

The Justice Department IG report and congressional reports about Russian active measures could appear next year at about the same time the congressional midterm elections are getting underway. Current and former intelligence bosses have warned that they'll be another major target for Russian active measures, suggesting this era's renaissance of dirty tricks will continue.

"Every time a U.S. service member is killed, it's followed by a choreographed ritual — that requires a very human touch — to return the dead to their families. It's part of war the public rarely sees.

But for Army Sgt. 1st Class A.G. Shaw, this work has been his life for 25 years. He's a ""92 Mike"" — that's military-speak for a specialist in mortuary affairs.

The job requires reverence and discretion. Thanks and recognition are rare. Shaw's comfort came from a supportive grandmother.

""In her estimation, you're doing God's work, because you're bringing closure to families and you're bringing folks home,"" he said.

Shaw is a big, burly man with a deep, calming voice. In a long military career that's winding down, he has seen the impact of U.S. wars from many places, and many angles.

He has recovered troops killed on the battlefield in Iraq. He has consoled families in the U.S. as they receive the body of a loved one.

A daughter and her father

One of his most powerful memories is from his time at a military base in Hawaii. He was handling the skeletal remains of a service member killed many years earlier in Vietnam.

""I ran across a young lady who was a baby when her father went off to war,"" he said. ""She's never had any physical contact with her father. She wanted to touch her father.""

The container holding his remains was opened.

""She had one of the backbones, and there's the way she was holding and touching and caressed this bone,"" he said.

""Those five minutes where she was in prayer and thought, and she was finally touching a physical piece of her father, even though it seemed macabre, it did something for her,"" he added. ""She washed her hands and she went home. She was crying and she was very thankful.""

At times like these, Shaw says, he is stoic on the outside, and limp on the inside.

Preparing for civilian life

""He's seen things that the majority of us, who saw one day of it, wouldn't be able to handle,"" said Meghan Ogilvie.

Ogilvie runs Dog Tag Bakery, a nonprofit group in the Georgetown section of Washington. The ground floor of the old, white-brick building is a working bakery, filled with the fragrance of cakes and coffee.

Those smells waft up to the second floor, where the group also has a classroom that helps train veterans like Shaw to enter the business world.

""If you have good music going, A.G. is dancing, he's moving, he's clapping, he's singing. He has a zest for life. He has it, and I think his service didn't allow him to always show it,"" she said. ""And maybe he has a greater passion for it because he's seen the other side.""

Reaching his ""number""

In a lengthy interview just outside Washington, Shaw wasn't inclined to talk about the global politics of America's wars. He speaks about honor and pride, his respect for the work and insights gleaned from his job.

Shaw says everyone in his profession has a ""number.""

""A number of instances, a number of traumas, a number of exposures before things just get too heavy,"" he said.

Shaw divides the job into three parts. All are challenging. All add to a person's ""number.""

Part 1, he says, is working with the bodies. This means autopsies and embalming. It wasn't easy, especially in the beginning.

""I found it hard to look the decedents in their face,"" he said. ""I would have this problem, because I got to imagining this person's life. And it ticks away at you.""

In Iraq, troops were often killed by powerful roadside bombs.

""It's not like the movies. We don't die pretty,"" he said.

The second part of the mission is putting a service member's affairs in order. This includes gathering the belongings of the deceased.

""When you're there packing their room for them, now you see what kind of person they were. You're seeing what they read, what they like, the video games they played, the music, the type of clothes they wore. It hits you.""

The third part is comforting the families.

This often involves meeting at a civilian airport and escorting the family on a lengthy car ride to collect the remains at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.

""Sometimes they want to engage you. Sometimes they are speaking among themselves. Sometimes it's just regular things — 'Did I leave the stove on?' Some of these people you want to hug, and tell them it's going to be OK,"" he said.

It can also be tense.

""It's not always pleasant for the service member. You have people like, 'You will not bury him in this uniform.' 'Why are you here, you killed them?' "" he said. ""But you have to be professional. You take it.""

""Invisible scars""

Shaw just turned 44, and this is the only real job he has had. He has done it much longer than most. And he feels the strain they all do at some point.

""We have invisible scars,"" he said. ""We're not going to tell somebody, 'I can't take it.' We're going to do the job. We love this job and somebody has to do it. That's the mentality.""

But he says it's time for him to move on.

""I think I've reached my number,"" he said. ""So I want to do something that's happier than dealing with people's grief and sad emotions.""

Shaw says he is not yet sure what he'll do, though he knows what puts him at ease.

""I do photography. I'm going to see how far that takes me, because, you got a camera, people smile at you, and you encapsulate happy times,"" he said.

He retires Jan. 2. He's heading to St. Louis — where he grew up — to start a new chapter with his wife and their two teenagers.

"Updated at 6:26 p.m. ET

FBI Director Christopher Wray defended his agency on Capitol Hill Thursday, speaking publicly for the first time since President Trump denigrated the agency last weekend. The questioning from lawmakers and the responses the new FBI director gave are a harbinger of likely issues to be raised again as the Justice Department's Russia probe appears to be intensifying after the recent plea deal of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""There is no shortage of opinions out there,"" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. ""What I can tell you is the FBI I see is tens of thousands of agents and analysts and staff working their tails off to keep Americans safe from the next terrorist attack; gang violence; child predators; spies from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.""

""The FBI I see,"" Wray added, ""is tens of thousands of brave men and women who are working as hard as they can to keep people that they will never know safe from harm.""

That description is a far cry from how the president described the agency on Sunday, when he said ""its reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!"" in a tweet.

After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.

The hearing, like many others this year, was starkly divided along party lines.

Republican lawmakers continued a trend in working to discredit or doubt the FBI and Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. They intensely focused on revelations that came to light last week about Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on both the Hillary Clinton email probe under former FBI Director James Comey and Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in last year's presidential election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Strzok's anti-Trump text messages led to his removal from the special counsel's investigative team over the summer.

The inspector general for the Justice Department is currently looking at Strzok's behavior, and whether any FBI investigators improperly allowed their political leanings to affect the Clinton investigation. Many times, Wray said he was unable to give further details on Strzok's actions or the actions of others, because of the ongoing IG investigation.

Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, read off a list of FBI employees and had Wray confirm that he hadn't seen any political bias from the five officials.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that if every member of Mueller's team who was ""anti-Trump"" were kicked off the investigation, ""I don't know if there'd be anyone left."" Therefore, Jordan suggested that there had to be more going on with Strzok that was not yet known publicly — or even, in a more confidential or secure setting, known yet to members of Congress.

Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, among others, specifically mentioned the fact that Strzok had a hand in adjusting former FBI Director James Comey's statement last summer about Hillary Clinton's email server. As CNN reported, Strzok changed Comey's key description of Clinton's actions from ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless.""

""The depths of this anti-Trump bias on the Mueller team just goes on and on,"" said Rep. Chabot. ""It's absolutely shocking.""

Mueller is a registered Republican, as NPR Justice Correspondent Carrie Johnson has reported, who has been tapped by both Democratic and Republican presidents over the years.

""Mueller is kind of the rare person in Washington, D.C., who just does his job — head down, does the work, makes the calls based on his judgment of what's right and wrong,"" Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general under President Obama and now a partner at Hogan Lovells, told NPR.

In Thursday's hearing, Democrats sought to push the focus back on Trump's comments and actions, and the actions of members of his campaign last year. They repeatedly gave Wray an opportunity to dispute the president's portrayal of the FBI as an agency ""in tatters.""

""My experience has been that our reputation is quite good,"" Wray said, responding to questioning from Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.

Wray also faced questions about potential legal trouble for Trump personally arising from Mueller's investigation.

Details from the charging documents related to Flynn's plea deal and Trump's recent tweets have given fresh life to questions about obstruction of justice related to the president's decision to fire Comey.

Wray repeatedly deflected questions about whether Trump's decision to fire Comey would put him in legal jeopardy. The FBI director did, however, reassure lawmakers that Trump has not tried to interfere with his work or asked him to pledge any sort of loyalty oath directly to Trump, as Comey famously said the president did to him.

Instead, Wray re-affirmed comments from his confirmation hearings where he said his loyalty was to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. ""There isn't a person on this planet that can get me to drop a properly predicated investigation or start an investigation that's not properly predicated,"" Wray told Rep. Eric Swalwell, D.-Calif. Asked by Swalwell whether he believed President Trump was above the law, Wray responded: ""I don't believe anybody is above the law.""

Multiple Democratic lawmakers also questioned Wray about a recent FBI report about so-called black identity extremists. The report has been cause for concern from several African-American members of the committee, who say the groups don't actually exist, and that the FBI should be focused instead on white nationalist extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.

Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., told Wray that she can't recommend that black activists who are among her constituents even speak to the FBI, because it's unclear ""where the FBI is coming from,"" in her words.

""[The report] sends a chill to activists around the country,"" Bass said. ""And my big concern is that local law enforcement will misinterpret that and will clamp down on people exercising their First Amendment rights.""

To protect upcoming U.S. elections, Wray said that the FBI has set up a foreign influence task force that draws on the expertise of several divisions of the agency — and, Wray added, the FBI is working in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security which has set up a similar multi-disciplinary group within that agency.

The most prominent non-Russia related topic at the hearing was federal surveillance.

The FISA Amendments Act, known as Section 702, which allows federal agencies to eavesdrop on communications and review email without following an open and public warrant process, is set to expire at the end of the year.

The FBI and other agencies in the intelligence community have said the law is critical to fighting terrorism, and Wray said he supports legislation to extend it that would protect ""not only the Constitution but protect our national security.""

"Updated at 6:28 p.m. ET

Former FBI Director James Comey will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that President Trump did ask him for ""loyalty"" at a January dinner and later told him alone in the Oval Office that he ""hope[d] you can let"" the investigation into former national security director Michael Flynn ""go.""  The opening statement from Comey, released by the committee less than 24 hours before his testimony, effectively confirms many of the bombshell reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post over the past month that have raised the question of whether the president tried to interfere in the ongoing investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Moscow.

Comey was fired by Trump last month, and the president later said the Russia investigation factored into his decision. Comey will testify that in March, Trump called him and asked what the FBI could do to ""lift the cloud"" around him and his administration involving Russia.

The former FBI director details an awkward Jan. 27 dinner with Trump, at which the president asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director. The president later said he expected ""loyalty"" from Comey despite the FBI's independence from the White House:

My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI's traditionally independent status in the executive branch. ...

I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not ""reliable"" in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody's side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.

A few moments later, the President said, ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty."" I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.

And Comey confirms earlier reports, which sources had confirmed to NPR, about his solo Oval Office conversation on Feb. 14 with Trump the day after Flynn had been asked to resign after he misled Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition. According to Comey, Trump signaled for him to stay behind after Attorney General Jeff Sessions lingered:

The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, ""He is a good guy and has been through a lot."" He repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" I replied only that ""he is a good guy."" (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would ""let this go.""

Comey says he immediately prepared an unclassified memo of his conversation with Trump and shared the events with senior FBI officials. However, he says he did not interpret that the president was asking him to drop the entire Russia probe:

I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn's departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI's role as an independent investigative agency.

During a May 18 news conference, Trump denied that he had asked Comey to scuttle his investigation into Flynn and denied that there had been any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Comey says he did not inform Sessions about that conversation because he anticipated the attorney general would have to recuse himself from the Russia probe (which Sessions did two weeks later), nor did he talk with it about with then-Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, who was only the interim deputy. However, he did tell Sessions that being left alone with Trump ""was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply.""

Comey says that he had ""nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months — three in person and six on the phone"" and that he wrote memos after each of those encounters, some of which he shared with top FBI officials. In comparison, he spoke alone with President Barack Obama only twice in two years and never on the phone.

Comey's testimony does support the president's assertion in his termination letter to Comey that the former FBI director assured him on three occasions that he, personally, was not under investigation. However, Comey was wary of that being publicized and told Trump in a March 30 phone call:

I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, ""We need to get that fact out."" (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)

But, according to Comey, the president did appear to press him to go even further in his final phone call with Trump before he was fired:

On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I ""get out"" that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that ""the cloud"" was getting in the way of his ability to do his job.

He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, ""Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know."" I did not reply or ask him what he meant by ""that thing."" I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.

During a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One, returning from Ohio where Trump had just given a speech on infrastructure, White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that she wasn't aware whether or not the president had a chance yet to review Comey's opening remarks.

""I did find the timing of the release a little bit interesting, directly after testimony from...hearing earlier today,"" Sanders did say, referring to testimony by top intelligence officials before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier on Wednesday where two of them declined to speak in an open hearing about their private conversations with the president.

Republicans quickly zeroed in on Comey's confirmation that he had indeed assured Trump three times that he personally was not under investigation.

""President Trump was right,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""Director Comey's statement reconfirmed what the president has been saying all along — he was never under investigation.""

Marc Kasowitz, Trump's private attorney recently engaged on the Russia investigation, said in a statement that Trump was ""pleased"" that Comey had confirmed those assurances he gave the president.

""The president feels completely and totally vindicated,"" Kasowitz said. ""He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.""

But Democrats found plenty of damning admissions in Comey's opening comments. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement that the former FBI director's ""testimony confirms a host of troubling allegations concerning the President's conduct,"" particularly his request for loyalty from Comey and his request for Comey to scuttle the investigation into Flynn.

""Director Comey was right to be concerned that the President was trying to form a patronage relationship with him, in which the Director would guarantee loyalty in exchange for job security. Had the Director agreed to do so would have been antithetical to the independence of his agency; that he did not, does not mitigate the unethical nature of the President's request,"" Schiff said. ""The fact that this request, and the subsequent effort to have the Director drop the Flynn case, were made after the President excused everyone else from the room, strongly indicates that the President was more than aware of the illegitimacy of such demands.""

"The FISA Amendments Act has been approved for another five years, as the Senate voted to renew the law that grants the government wide surveillance authority. President Obama has said he intends to sign the measure, which senators approved by a 73-23 margin Friday morning. It had already won approval in the House.

Update at 6:10 p.m. Dec. 31: Obama signs FISA extension.

The president signed the FISA extension Sunday. Our original post continues:

The controversial bill, which allows federal agencies to eavesdrop on communications and review email without following an open and public warrant process, has long been a target for privacy and rights groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, which is involved in a Supreme Court case over FISA.

The original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act dates back to 1978; it was expanded during the Bush administration in 2008, to allow both foreign and domestic surveillance without a warrant, as long as the intent is to gather foreign intelligence.

When it was amended in 2008, FISA also provided ""retroactive immunity to the telecom companies that assisted the Bush administration in its warrantless wiretapping program,"" as Open Congress notes in its summary.

Before Friday's vote, the 2012 FISA extension faced several attempts to amend it, including one made by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who sought to require the director of national intelligence to share information about telephone and email surveillance — how many Americans have been monitored, for instance, or whether communications between Americans is reviewed.

The Wyden amendment was rejected by a 52-43 vote, an indication of the contentiousness surrounding the bill's granting of intelligence-gathering powers. The amendment had bipartisan support that included Democratic Sens. Al Franken and Patty Murray and Republican Sens. Dean Heller and Pat Toomey, among others.

But the measure also faced bipartisan opposition. Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), the ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke against the Wyden amendment, with Feinstein saying it would expose ""information about a very effective intelligence collection program that is currently classified."" She added that the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees already review all of the material.

A similar measure, introduced by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), sought to require the Attorney General to disclose some of the decisions and orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, whose records are generally not available to the public. The Merkley measure failed by a 54-37 margin.

Another amendment, offered by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), sought ""to ensure adequate protection of the rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States"" — the portion of the Bill of Rights that protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. Paul's amendment was defeated, 79-12.

"The Grinch's psychological problems have been pretty well analyzed. He has anger and empathy issues, not to mention sociopathic tendencies. No wonder he tried to steal Christmas.

But what about the Grinch's defining physical disability: a heart that was ""two sizes too small""?

""It's a tough problem,"" says Dr. David Kass, a professor of cardiology at Johns Hopkins University who has been studying the Grinch. ""We don't see this very much.""

There are rare conditions that effectively reduce the size of the heart, Kass says, and they're no fun.

""You're going to have that small heart beating twice as fast"" in order to supply enough blood, he says. ""That means you're going to feel your heart racing all the time.""

So how could that heart be two sizes too small?

That could make you grumpy. And it would definitely make it hard to perform physical labor, like sliding down every chimney in Whoville to make off with all the Christmas presents.

Kass doubts that sort of exertion would even be possible for someone whose cardiac output was so limited. ""He would be doing more traditional Grinchy things, just sitting around moping,"" Kass says.

And from a cardiologist's point of view, the story takes an even more remarkable twist as the Grinch gazes down at the happy Whos from atop Mount Crumpit:

And what happened then...?

 Well...in Whoville they say 

That the Grinch's small heart

Grew three sizes that day!

That is possible, sort of, Kass says. ""There are situations where the human heart can fairly rapidly get large,"" he says. ""But you don't feel good when that happens. This couldn't be Grinch's issue.""

So Kass has settled on a different explanation for the Grinch's fast-growing heart: ""He's really a snake,"" he says. ""I mean not just any snake, he's a python.""

Specifically, a Burmese python.

That makes sense, Kass says, because the heart of a Burmese python is designed to grow rapidly after a big meal.

Like a generous helping of roast beast?

""That would do it,"" Kass says.

Indeed, Dr. Seuss, author of the 1957 classic book How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, seems to hint at a herpetological explanation in his text. He writes that the Grinch ""slithered"" around the room where he met little Cindy Lou Who.

But Kass says even the snake-who-had-a-big-meal hypothesis isn't perfect.

""When a snake like a python has done that, does he like run around lifting sleds?"" Kass says. ""No. He looks like all of us after Thanksgiving. We're on the couch. If we can watch TV, that's about it.""

Kass talks about the Grinch's cardiovascular health in this video.

And scientists at Johns Hopkins scientists have come up with theories for the condition of other seasonal characters, including Rudolph's red nose and Ebenezer Scrooge's time travel.

"Updated at 6:49 p.m. ET on July 7

Christopher Wray, President Trump's pick to lead the FBI, will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, July 12. But even as he makes his case to take the reins of the law enforcement agency, there's plenty of ongoing drama from the fallout over the firing of his predecessor, James Comey.

In fact, it's a story that has now continued past Comey's termination, with a winding narrative that has seen the president make veiled threats and contradict his own staff as well as the vice president. While the president insinuated on Twitter he had tapes of his conversations with Comey, he later conceded on June 22 that he does not have and did not make any such tapes. But the House Intelligence Committee is not satisfied with Trump's explanation and has threatened to subpoena the White House to see if there are any recorded conversations.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions' appearance June 13 before the Senate Intelligence Committee was the latest major chapter in a saga that began long before President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9.

It began even before the announcement Comey made in late October 2016 that Hillary Clinton partly blames him for her 2016 electoral loss to Trump.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee June 8, Comey upped the ante when he said the president had lied about him and the FBI.

Here's a timeline of key Comey-related events:

Oct. 1, 2015: Comey tells reporters that FBI investigators looking into possible compromise of information on Clinton's private email server would be fiercely independent, because they ""don't give a rip about politics.""

""Part of doing our work well is to make sure we don't talk about it,"" he said, approximately a year and 27 days before talking about the FBI's work in a pretty public way.

July 2, 2016: Trump tweets that it ""is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,"" setting up a major conflict when Comey goes public with his investigation announcement just a few days later. Trump's theme continues throughout July, as the Republican National Convention is peppered with ""Lock her up!"" chants.

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

July 5, 2016: Comey announces that the FBI is recommending the Justice Department not bring charges against Clinton for her handling of classified data. Still, Comey says Clinton and her staff were ""extremely careless"" in using a private email server and adds that he thinks it's possible classified information on the server could have been hacked by ""a hostile actor.""

The appearance at the FBI headquarters in Washington gives ammunition to the Trump campaign and sets Comey up to serve as Trump's latest political foil.

Aug. 22, 2016: Trump makes news at a rally in Akron, Ohio, when he argues a special prosecutor is needed for the Justice Department to ""investigate Hillary Clinton's crimes.""

""The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really, sadly, a political arm of the White House,"" Trump says.

Ken Gormley, president of Duquesne University and author of two books on special prosecutors, spoke to NPR's Carrie Johnson at the time. ""If you look at the chronology, pretty much the political party that does not control the White House tends to want special prosecutors and independent counsel laws,"" he said. ""As soon as the party is in the White House, they don't want it anymore.""

The message would become relevant again when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats began calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's meddling in the U.S. election after news broke that Comey had been fired by Trump.

Oct. 28, 2016: In a letter to the leaders of congressional oversight committees, Comey notifies Congress that the FBI is reopening the investigation into the handling of classified information in connection with Democratic presidential candidate Clinton.

""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,"" Comey wrote. ""I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.""

Republicans quickly jumped on the opportunity to bash Clinton. At a rally in New Hampshire, Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before."" And the Republican National Committee added that the FBI's decision to reopen the investigation ahead of the election ""shows how serious this discovery must be.""

No information was revealed about the content of the newly uncovered emails, but by the end of the day, sources had confirmed to NPR the emails were found through an unrelated criminal investigation of Anthony Weiner.

Oct. 30-31, 2016: The FBI obtains the search warrant necessary to examine the newly found emails. At this point, there's still no confirmation of whether the emails contained any new information or even whether they were sent or received by Clinton.

During this time, the assistant attorney general wrote a letter to Democratic senators assuring them that the Justice Department was dedicating ""all necessary resources"" to go through the emails as quickly as possible.

These stories illustrate the vague daily news dribble, spurred by Comey's announcement, that helped get the words ""Clinton"" and ""email"" back into headlines, just a week before voters went to the polls.

Nov. 6, 2016: Comey announces that the new trove of emails doesn't change the FBI's recommendation that the Justice Department not charge Clinton for her handling of classified information.

""Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,"" Comey wrote to 16 chairmen and ranking members of relevant House and Senate committees. ""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""

Sources told NPR that almost every email the FBI reviewed in the new batch was a duplicate of an email the bureau had already seen.

Trump uses the news to call the FBI, and Comey by extension, ""rigged.""

""Right now, [Clinton's] being protected by a rigged system,"" Trump told a crowd in Michigan. ""You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days — you just can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.""

Nov. 8, 2016: Trump defeats Clinton in the presidential election, with an Electoral College victory of 306 to 232. Clinton wins the popular vote by almost 3 million votes. Trump will become the next president of the United States.

Neither Clinton nor Trump mentions Comey or the Oct. 28 letter in election night speeches.

Jan. 22, 2017: Two days after Donald Trump becomes President Trump, Comey and the president meet at a reception for law enforcement and security officials in the White House Blue Room. Trump calls Comey over and they hug.

""He's become more famous than me,"" Trump said with a chuckle, according to Reuters.

March 8, 2017: At a cyber conference in Boston, Comey reiterates that he intends to serve the entirety of his 10-year term. ""You're stuck with me for about 6 1/2 years,"" he says.

The comments follow Comey's urging the Justice Department for days to issue a public denial of Trump's accusations of wiretapping against President Obama.

NPR's Carrie Johnson reported at the time that Comey ""has demonstrated a nearly unique ability to draw critics from both ends of the political spectrum.""

March 20, 2017: Comey confirms that the FBI is investigating ""whether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia's efforts"" to interfere in the 2016 election. He made the statement during the first open hearing on Russian meddling, held by the House Intelligence Committee.

May 2, 2017: Clinton says that if it weren't for Comey's Oct. 28, 2016, letter, she would be president.

""It wasn't a perfect campaign — there's no such thing — but I was on the way to winning until a few things happened,"" Clinton tells CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour at a women's leadership luncheon.

""If the election was on Oct. 27, I'd be your president,"" Clinton added.

Trump fired back later that night, tweeting ""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!""

May 3, 2017: The FBI director testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and tells Congress that it makes him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his late October decision could have swung the election.

Still, he defends himself.

""Lordy, has this been painful,"" he told committee members. ""I've gotten all kinds of rocks thrown at me, and this has been really hard, but I think I've done the right thing at each turn.""

He also has an exchange with Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, about whether senior Justice Department officials can ""halt"" an FBI investigation if they oppose it. ""In theory, yes,"" it can happen, Comey says. ""Has it happened?"" Hirono asks. ""Not in my experience,"" Comey responds.

May 9, 2017: Trump suddenly fires Comey on a Tuesday afternoon.

May 11, 2017: Trump contradicts his White House staff as well as the vice president over the reasoning. At first, staffers said Trump acted on the assessment of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but in an interview with NBC News, Trump says he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's advice.

""It was set up a while ago,"" Trump told Lester Holt on May 11. ""And frankly, I could have waited, but what difference does it make?""

Just before the firing, the FBI sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley correcting aspects of Comey's May 3 testimony. The letter came after ProPublica first reported inaccuracies in Comey's statements to Congress.

From ProPublica's Peter Elkind:

""In (the letter), the FBI acknowledged that only a 'small number' of more than 49,000 'potentially relevant' emails found on Weiner's laptop had been forwarded from Clinton deputy Huma Abedin to Weiner, her husband, not hundreds or thousands as Comey had stated. The FBI said just two of those messages contained classified information.""

May 12, 2017: Trump tweets on Friday, ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" The following Monday, journalists in the White House briefing continued to ask press secretary Sean Spicer to comment on the implication of a taping system in the Oval Office. Spicer did not clarify.

May 16, 2017: Two sources close to Comey say that Trump asked him to close down the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn a day after Flynn was fired. Comey, who was still FBI director at the time, wrote a memo about the exchange immediately after the Oval Office conversation in February, an associate of Comey's told NPR.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sends a request to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe for ""memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating"" to communications between Comey and Trump, setting a deadline of May 24.

The White House has denied that the president ever asked for the investigation to end. The FBI would not comment, but McCabe testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 11 that ""there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.""

May 17, 2017: The Senate Intelligence Committee invites Comey to testify in open and closed sessions. It also sends a request to McCabe ""seeking any notes or memorandum prepared by the former Director regarding any communications he may have had with senior White House and Department of Justice officials related to investigations into Russia's efforts."" The Senate Judiciary Committee is also seeking the alleged memos and related documentation.

Rosenstein appoints former FBI Director Robert Mueller to lead the Russia investigation as a special counsel.

May 18, 2017: Trump denies asking Comey to shut down the Flynn investigation during a joint press conference with the president of Colombia, responding curtly to a reporter with: ""No. No. Next question."" He also changes his rationale for firing Comey again, saying he based his decision on Rosenstein's recommendation. Rosenstein briefs senators the same day, saying he knew that Comey would be fired before he wrote the memo.

May 19, 2017: Rosenstein talks to members of the House, later releasing his opening remarks to lawmakers, in which he says he stands by the memo he wrote about Comey and that he ""thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.""

The Senate Intelligence Committee says Comey will testify in an open hearing, to be scheduled after Memorial Day (the committee later announced it would take place on June 8). Comey turned down the Senate Judiciary Committee's request.

Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that Trump told Russian officials during a May 10 meeting that he fired ""nut job"" Comey to ease the pressure of the mounting investigation into the election and his team's potential ties to Russia. White House press secretary Sean Spicer does not dispute the account.

May 22, 2017: In addition to reportedly pushing Comey on the Russia investigation, Trump asks top U.S. intelligence chiefs to push back against the FBI's investigation, The Washington Post reports.

A White House spokesman said in a statement, ""The White House does not confirm or deny unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals."" Asked about the report in later testimony, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said that he did not ""feel it's appropriate to characterize discussions with the president.""

May 25, 2017: House Oversight Committee Chairman Chaffetz says the FBI declined to release documents his panel had requested regarding communications between Comey and the president. Reuters reports: ""The FBI said it was still evaluating the request ... in light of the appointment of a special prosecutor"" to lead the Russia probe.

June 7, 2017: Trump announces he is nominating Christopher Wray to be FBI director. Wray is a former Justice Department official who currently works in the private sector.

Ahead of its hearing the next day, the Senate Intelligence Committee releases Comey's opening statement. In it, Comey corroborates much of what has been reported in The Washington Post and New York Times, saying the president asked him for ""loyalty"" and to let the Flynn investigation ""go."" Comey also says he had an awkward dinner with Trump on Jan. 27 at which the president asked whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director. Read NPR's analysis of the comments.

June 8, 2017: Comey testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee, in his first public comments since his dismissal. The hearing is one of the most closely watched testimonies in recent memory, even prompting bars in D.C. and beyond to open early and host watch parties.

Comey says the Trump administration ""chose to defame"" him by saying the FBI was ""poorly led"" under him. He adds that the White House lied in arguing he was let go for any reason other than the ongoing Russia investigation, and that he documented his conversations with President Trump because he ""was honestly concerned [Trump] might lie"" about their meetings.

He says plainly that he told his friend to release his memos to the New York Times, specifically hoping they would lead to the appointment of a special counsel.

And that's just the hearing that was open to the public. Comey continues to speak to senators in a closed afternoon session.

White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tells reporters after the testimony that she ""can definitely say the president is not a liar."" And Trump sends out his personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, to make a statement on his behalf.

""[Comey] also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference,"" he says. He also claims Trump never told Comey he needed loyalty from him ""in any form or substance,"" even though the president ""is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration.""

June 9, 2017: In a joint press conference with the president of Romania, Trump says he would be willing to testify under oath about his interactions with Comey.

""Frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said — and some of the things that he said just weren't true,"" Trump says in his first on-camera remarks following Comey's testimony. He doubles down on Kasowitz's claim that he never asked Comey for a loyalty pledge or urged him to do away with an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

When asked whether he would be willing to speak with special counsel Robert Mueller under oath about his conversations with Comey, Trumps responds: ""100 percent.""

June 13, 2017: Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee. It's his first public appearance before Congress since Jan. 10, when he said he ""did not have communications with the Russians."" It was later reported that Sessions had in fact met twice with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in 2016, though Sessions insists those were part of his role as a senator at the time and were not about the Trump campaign.

Sessions recused himself in March from any investigations into Russia's actions in the 2016 election. At the time, Sessions said he was recusing himself because he was an adviser for the campaign. Comey's testimony on June 8 cast doubt on that reasoning, when the former FBI director said he had thought Sessions would recuse himself weeks before he did because of reasons that were classified.

Testifying before his former colleagues in the Senate, Sessions denies any suggestion that he was involved in any collusion with the Russians. The attorney general called such allegations ""an appalling and detestable lie.""

With regard to Comey's firing, Sessions said he agreed with the assessment provided by Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein. Furthermore, Sessions explained, ""It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render the attorney general unable to manage the leadership of the various department of justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.""

June 14, 2017: Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump for possible obstruction of justice, the Washington Post reports. Comey's firing is a ""central moment that's being looked at"" in Mueller's investigation, the Post's Devlin Barrett told NPR's Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered, ""but it's not the only thing."" Investigators are also considering the conversations Comey and the president had leading up to the firing.

June 15, 2017: President Trump takes to Twitter in the wake of the Post's report and calls the Russia inquiry ""the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history ...."" ""They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story,"" Trump also says on Twitter, ""found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice""

June 16, 2017: Trump tweets, ""I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt."" Within hours, people close to the president seek to clarify the tweet. A person close to the president's legal team told NPR's Scott Horsley that the tweet referred to the Wednesday Washington Post report regarding possible obstruction of justice. The tweet was not confirmation that the president or his attorney has been informed by the Department of Justice or Mueller that Trump is the subject of an investigation.

June 22, 2017: After dangling the threat over Comey about tapes of their conversation — a prospect the former FBI director memorably said he would relish during his testimony before the Senate — Trump finally conceded over a month later that, as most people expected, that he did not make and does not have any such tapes. ""With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,"" the president tweeted. The White House would not elaborate why Trump waited 41 days to clarify his mysterious tweet that suggested otherwise.

June 29, 2017: The denial a week earlier from the president about the existence of tapes wasn't enough for the House Intelligence Committee, which threatened to subpoena any tapes to ""ensure a satisfactory response"" over their possible existence. ""By only referring to the President's statement, the White House's letter stops short of clarifying for the Committee whether the White House has any responsive recordings, memoranda, or other documents,"" Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a joint statement.

"A warming planet due to human-induced climate change is likely to contribute to an increase in volcanic activity, according to a recent study in the journal Geology.

While a relationship between climate and volcanism might seem counterintuitive, it turns out that pressure exerted by thick glaciers on the Earth's crust — what geologists call ""surface loading"" — has an impact on the flow of magma below the surface.

The correlation affects ""magma flow and the voids and gaps in the Earth where magma flows to the surface as well as how much magma the crust can actually hold,"" study lead author Graeme T. Swindles, an associate professor of Earth system dynamics at the University of Leeds, wrote in an email to Scientific American. 

In the study, published last month, Swindles' team examined the geologic record of eruptions of Icelandic volcanoes 5,500 to 4,500 years ago — a period in Earth's history when the climate was cooler, but still not a full-blown ice age. The level of volcanic activity was discerned by looking at the record of ash that fell over Europe and settled on the peat bogs and lakes, Swindles says.

Comparing the volcanic record with glacial coverage, the team found that the number of eruptions dropped significantly as the climate cooled and ice cover increased. The eruptions that did occur also tended to be smaller in magnitude.

""There's a big change in the record in the mid-Holocene [epoch], where we see no volcanic ash in Europe and very little in Iceland,"" says Swindles. ""This seems to overlap with a time where there's cold climate conditions, which would have favored glacial advance in Iceland.""

Swindles says his team found about a 600-year lag between advancing glaciers and diminished volcanic activity. ""That's because it takes a long time to grow ice masses,"" he told the magazine.

In reverse, the team found that as the climate warmed and glaciers melted, there were more and bigger eruptions.

""After glaciers are removed the surface pressure decreases, and the magmas more easily propagate to the surface and thus erupt,"" Swindles says.

There was also a lag between retreating glaciers and increased volcanic activity, but it was shorter, the team found — although the study cautions there could be other climate-related factors that contributed to the compressed lag time.

"It's that time of year — road congestion, delayed flights, and the slow-burning anxiety of heading home for the holidays. More than 100 million Americans travel between Saturday and New Year's Day, AAA predicts - a number that has gone up steadily since 2005. Whether you're driving, flying, or sleighing this year, here are a few things you should know.

1. Watch out for record-breaking traffic

If you live in a major city, it's probably going to be bad. The American Automobile Association predicts that drivers in major cities could see traffic times up to three times longer than normal. An unprecedented 107 million Americans are estimated to spend their holidays away from home this year – and 97.4 million of them will hit the roads to get there. Plan your car trips accordingly, and if you live in a major metropolis, try to leave in the early morning or after the morning commute.

2. Watch the road — there's a high risk for crashes and injuries

The National Safety Council estimates that car crashes during the Christmas holiday period (starting on Friday, Dec. 22 and ending on Dec. 25) could lead to 308 deaths and 35,400 serious injuries this year alone — and that's not even counting New Year's.

3. Americans are avoiding flying out of a hatred for airline fees ...

Americans avoided 32 million air trips out of sheer frustration last year, costing the U.S. economy over $24 billion. A survey by the U.S. Travel Association found that 60 percent of fliers say airline fees have gotten worse, and 51 percent say the overall cost of flying has gotten worse. 

4. ... and a hatred of flying in general

The Travel Association survey also found that 47 percent of fliers say airport hassles have gotten worse, while one in four adults ""skipped a leisure trip in the past five years due to air travel concerns."" Unfortunately for commuters, those people probably just chose to drive instead. 

5. The busiest days to fly will be the Friday before Christmas and the day after Christmas

Airlines for America reports that despite people's frustration with flying, Friday, December 22 and Tuesday, December 26 will be the busiest travel days of the year, with a staggering 2.7 million fliers on both days. That's compared to an average of 2.25 million air passengers per day in 2016. If you're planning to fly on those days, you may want to consider traveling by reindeer or on Santa's sleigh instead.

"Donald Trump's campaign was frenzied and frantic, people at the top have said — descriptions that could be highly consequential for the White House and to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.

For former campaign officials who've come into the administration, the descriptions of their work last year are meant not only to strengthen their denials regarding collusion with the Russian government in attacking the election, but also to emphasize how much of a miracle it was they made it through.

""It was a brilliant campaign, I think, in many ways, but it was a form of chaos every day, from Day 1,"" as Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee recently. ""We traveled sometimes to several places in one day. Sleep was in short supply, and I was still a full-time senator with a very full schedule.""

Even as Trump's campaign team casts itself as a pack of novices fighting uphill for a historic victory, Mueller's team may hear something very different.

Counterintelligence specialists may hear a story about a disorganized entity with many openings through which a foreign government could burrow. Prosecutors may see an attempt to lay the groundwork for cover-up underneath what Sessions called the ""chaos.""

And what critics hear are people making a case for exactly why the campaign might want to cooperate with anyone willing to help them, including a foreign power: It was frenzied and frantic, it felt behind the curve, and it wanted all the help it could get to win.

""Do you think it was appropriate that Donald Trump, Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign?"" as Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked Sessions at the Nov. 14 hearing. The attorney general said he declined to make a judgment.

Trump Jr. insists he did nothing wrong and has stuck to the chaos defense.

""I had never worked on a campaign before, and it was an exhausting, all-encompassing, life-changing experience,"" Donald Trump Jr. told members of Congress in September.

""Every single day I fielded dozens, if not hundreds, of emails and phone calls,"" Trump Jr. continued. ""Because my father started off as the underdog, we had a very modest staff and were forced to learn as we went along. Every day presented numerous challenges and required my attention to many different issues.""

What effect might the chaos defense have in any eventual criminal trials arising from Mueller's investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election?

""It really depends on what the charge is,"" said Stephen Saltzburg, a former high-ranking lawyer of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department who is now a professor at the George Washington University Law School.

""If they forgot to file something they were supposed to file — 'oh, we were so preoccupied!' But if, on the other hand, someone is charged with lying to the FBI, if they've had time to think about what the FBI is asking, it's a little bit more of a stretch to believe the hectic pace of the campaign caused them to say something that was untrue.""

One person in the Trump orbit, a junior campaign adviser named George Popodoupolos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. According to court documents, he was not initially truthful about the overtures he received from Russian agents who reached out with offers of help to the campaign.

In Sessions' case, at least, that has not come up. The attorney general told members of the House Judiciary Committee that he hasn't been interviewed by Mueller or the special counsel's team.

In the case of Trump Jr. and his brother-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the harried pace of the campaign was one reason he agreed to host a Russian delegation at Trump Tower in June 2016 after he had received emails promising help from the Russian government.

""Despite overwhelming support from the American people, it was widely reported that some within the party were attempting to undermine the process in an effort to force a contested convention,"" as Trump Jr. remembered.

""While this was going on, we were also in the process of replacing our campaign manager,"" Trump Jr. continued. ""It was an extraordinarily intense period of time. In the midst of this maelstrom, on the morning of June 3, 2016, I received an email from Rob Goldstone.""

Goldstone, an entertainment publicist, was the last in a series of intermediaries to convey the Russian government's offer of help to the Family Trump. The two men coordinated to arrange a meeting at which a Russian attorney, a Russian-American lobbyist and others paid them a visit — the substance of which is in dispute.

Trump Jr. is due back on Capitol Hill next week to talk about that meeting in a closed session with the House Intelligence Committee.

Kushner has used the chaos defense to explain his role in the meeting. As he was going about his business amid the hectic bustle of the race, he got an email from Trump Jr. inviting him to the meeting. Kushner said he didn't read any of the preceding thread or know anything about what was taking place until he walked into the room.

""It was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign,"" he told members of Congress in July. ""I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange.""

Saltzburg said he did not know whether any laws had been broken in planning or convening the meeting. But he said the number of messages involved in arranging it and the apparent deliberateness with which the participants took part suggested there at least could have been breaks in the chaos.

""It may explain some things,"" he said. ""It may excuse some things. But it may not explain everything or excuse everything.""

"NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless has died at the age of 80, NASA announced Friday. You may not know his name, but you most likely have seen him in one of the most famous pictures ever taken in space. In 1984, McCandless strapped on a jet-powered backpack and flew away from the shuttle, by himself, untethered, with Earth as a backdrop. It was the first time an astronaut had ever floated freely in space; McCandless had helped develop the technology.

McCandless had been an astronaut for a long time before he first flew in space aboard the shuttle. His was one of the voices that kept the first moon-landing crew in touch with mission control in 1969, telling Neil Armstrong, ""There are a lot of us down here that would be willing to come along.""

While supporting other missions and waiting his turn, he helped design what became known as the MMU — the manned maneuvering unit.

McCandless first went to space in 1984 aboard the shuttle Challenger and took these jet-powered backpacks along. During the mission, McCandless climbed into the 300-pound contraption and slowly eased out of the shuttle's cargo bay. This time, it was mission controllers on the ground saying to him, ""You have a lot of envious people watching you. Looks like you're having a lot of fun up there.""

Armstrong was on McCandless' mind when he took that first untethered foray into space. More than three decades later, in an NPR interview, he remembered precisely what he said: "" 'It may have been one small step for Neil. But it's a heckuva big leap for me.'

""My wife happened to be at mission control at the time and she says the laughter literally brought down the house. Which was sort of what I had intended because I wanted to loosen things up a little,"" he recalled.

Relative to Earth, he was flying at almost 18,000 miles per hour. But relative to the shuttle, he was moving at a leisurely 1 foot per second. He said he wasn't nervous. He found it effortless.

He had trained for that moment for years, ready for anything — the suit's nitrogen propulsion system failing or problems communicating with the shuttle. But what he wasn't prepared for was the temperature in the suit: ""I got quite cold. My teeth were chattering. I was shivering,"" he said.

The suit was designed so astronauts could work strenuously, but for that first six-hour test, he had moved little more than 300 feet away from the shuttle when the famous picture was taken, with Earth and space in the background.

""I had the gold sun visor down. So that in principle, people could imagine themselves inside of there instead of me,"" he said.

McCandless said he was most proud that, later in life, children came up to him to say they'd seen the picture. He hoped it would inspire the next generation of explorers. ""I like to encourage folks to look at that and say, 'Well, I can do better than that.' ""

"The New Year will bring a new test for President Trump and the United States' relationship with Russia.

Five years ago, President Obama signed a bill imposing sanctions on a group of powerful people there charged with involvement in the death of a Russian lawyer who uncovered a $230 million tax fraud scheme — and then died in government custody. The sanctions infuriated Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Since then, the State Department has put more people on its sanctions list, usually at the beginning of each year, and the choice it makes next month about who or how many people it adds could be consequential.

""This is the big test for Donald Trump about whether he is really a friend of Putin's or whether he's a tough guy as to whether he actually adds names,"" said Bill Browder, a financier-turned-advocate who pushed for the sanctions.

""This is highly significant and highly pregnant with meaning whatever he does or doesn't do, if he really wants to take the wind out of the sails of this collusion narrative,"" Browder also said.

That ""narrative"" is what has prompted the Justice Department, in an investigation now led by special counsel Robert Mueller, and several congressional committees to look into any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia which attacked the 2016 presidential election.

The White House has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Russian election interference by anyone associated with the Trump campaign, and it points to Trump's own signature on a separate Russia sanctions bill from earlier this year. Congress passed those additional restrictions on Russia following its attack on the election and also constrained Trump's ability to ease them without lawmakers' approval.

But Browder said one way to measure Washington's current willingness to placate — or annoy — Moscow will be to watch for what the State Department does about the older Magnitsky Act.

That's the bill passed in 2012 and signed five years ago Thursday by Obama, after intense lobbying by Browder. Attorney Sergey Magnitsky, for whom the legislation was named, worked for Browder in Moscow and was arrested when he reported his discovery about the amount of money being stolen by powerful Russians. Magnitsky died in custody, beaten to death while chained to a bed in a prison cell — and Browder has been telling his story ever since.

""I made a vow to his memory, to his family, to myself that I was going to go out and get the people who killed him and make sure they faced justice,"" Browder told NPR.

The Russian government has long denied any wrongdoing or cover-up efforts — at different points accusing Browder of murdering Magnitsky — and also arguing the lawyer died of natural causes.

Since the law went into effect, Moscow and its advocates have been working inside the United States to get Congress to lift the sanctions.

A Russian contingent met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in part to talk about the Magnitsky Act. Before that, Russian advocates Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin worked for years to discredit Browder.

Meanwhile, Browder has been leading the charge not only for the United States to sanction more Russians under its Magnitsky Act, but for other governments to pass their own version of the sanctions law.

That's despite Russian attempts to have him arrested by Interpol, in an attempt to get him returned to Russia.

""It's not just arrest,"" he told NPR last month, after the Kremlin issued its most recent Interpol warrant. ""They could try to assassinate me on the street. They've made these threats, and so I am genuinely Putin's No. 1 foreign enemy, and they'd like to wipe me out one way or another.""

Still, he's scheduled to appear before the U.S. Helsinki Commission on Thursday to discuss the Magnitsky Act's anniversary.

And in the past two months, both Lithuania and Canada voted to enact their own versions of the legislation.

""It's a signal to every country where there are abusers that can be proven — we do not want them in our country,"" said Canadian Sen. Raynell Andreychuk, one of the bill's sponsors in Ottawa.

""I say [before this legislation passed], we were like enablers. We can sign all the international treaties, we can make all the statements in the U.N., but if we let them park their dirty money in Canada or buy property here or try to enter here, we then become enablers.""

"FBI Director James Comey said this week that he is ""mildly nauseous"" at the idea that the FBI may have swayed the presidential election results. A new report may ease that nausea, if only a little.

""We would conclude there is at best mixed evidence to suggest that the FBI announcement tipped the scales of the race,"" wrote a panel of polling experts in a report released Thursday, about the FBI's Oct. 28 announcement that it was investigating new information regarding Hillary Clinton's emails.

The new report, from the American Association for Public Opinion Research, goes far beyond the Comey letter, however. More than a dozen pollsters and public opinion experts worked for months to determine what might have led polls to overestimate Clinton's support. They found that state-level polls were particularly far off from the final election results, leading many forecasters to overestimate Clinton's chances of winning.

In response, the experts called for improvements in state-level polling to ensure that the polling profession doesn't suffer another ""black eye"" in coming years.

Here's a summary of which polls were off and the reasons for the miss, according to the researchers — as well as factors that, as it turned out, didn't seem to affect things much.

State polls were ""historically bad""

By far, more Americans believed Clinton would win than Donald Trump. Ahead of the election, half of Americans thought she would, per one Economist/YouGov poll, compared with only 27 percent who believed it would be Trump. Forecasting models doubtless contributed to that belief for at least some voters. Predictions from some of the most popular models (FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times' Upshot, for example) ranged from giving Clinton a 71 percent to 99 percent chance of winning.

So when she lost, everyone (including NPR) tried to answer the question: Why did polls — and, therefore, forecasting models — so often point to a Clinton win?

First of all, only some polls were off, and it wasn't the national polls. Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, and polls had her winning the popular vote by an average of 3 points. That's not much of a gap at all, compared with past presidential polling.

But state polls were off by an average of 5 points, the largest average since 2000. This is where the researchers drilled down into the whys of what went wrong.

Late deciders in swing states ended up going significantly pro-Trump

Part of the discrepancy between votes and polls was that voters did change their minds late — but it wasn't necessarily because of Comey. The decline in Clinton's support, the report finds, may have begun as early as Oct. 22, whereas Comey's announcement came on Oct. 28. That doesn't disprove that Comey's letter changed things, but it does suggest other factors were depressing Clinton's support at around the same time.

""The question is whether the letter made the decline more severe or somehow prevented her support from rebounding,"" said Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center and a co-author of the report, at a Thursday event at the National Press Club. ""I think that's an important question, but it's not knowable with the data available to us.""

Altogether, about 13 percent of voters nationally made up their minds in the final week, according to Pew data reviewed by the researchers. That's in line with past elections. However, in the swing states of Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, those late-deciding voters were far more likely to vote for Trump than for Clinton.

Nationwide, 45 percent of the late-deciding voters ended up voting for Trump, compared with 42 percent for Clinton. But in Michigan, for example, it was 50 percent for Trump and 39 percent for Clinton — and that was the smallest margin of these four states. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, it was 59 percent Trump and 30 percent Clinton.

""If we look back about the campaign events at that time, it was in those states — Wisconsin, Michigan — where you had the campaigns shifting their strategy at the very end of the campaign,"" Kennedy said.

Critics lambasted Clinton's swing state strategy, saying she did not invest enough time or manpower in places like Wisconsin and Michigan, particularly in the final days of campaigning.

Voters' education was another area that seemed to throw pollsters off. Voting patterns by education ended up being far different from what they had been in 2012.

In particular, the authors point out, the data show a U-shape in 2012 — people with high school diplomas only and postgrad degrees tended to vote more Democratic that year, while people in the middle (with college degrees or some college) were less Democratic. In 2016, it was more linear: The lowest-educated people were relatively more likely to vote for Trump.

Among higher-educated groups, people were more likely to vote for Clinton, with postgraduates by far the most likely to vote for her.

The problem is that pollsters didn't account for that, Kennedy said. Survey researchers do know that higher-educated people are more likely to participate in surveys. However, not all surveys factor that in.

""In 2016, that mattered,"" she said. ""Some elections you might get by without adjusting on education, but in 2016, you had to adjust on education.""

One final factor that could have thrown polls off is turnout. Turnout patterns clearly boosted Trump. The counties where President Obama performed worst in 2012 had higher turnout increases, while the counties that highly favored him had lower turnout increases, as the report points out.

The question is whether that different kind of turnout pattern threw off how pollsters adjusted their results. That seems plausible, said one researcher.

""To the extent that pollsters relied on 2012 as a model for the electorate either demographically or otherwise, there's the potential that that introduced error,"" said Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling for SurveyMonkey and one of the report's authors, at Thursday's event. ""For that reason, our conclusion is that turnout probably was one of the two or three things that introduced error into this process; it's just very difficult for us to to quantify it. It's kind of an incomplete. It's a story that's not completely told.""

What probably didn't affect the polls (much)

""Shy Trump voters"" came up a lot in the run-up to the election, referring to the worry that Trump voters were reluctant to tell a live pollster that they supported him.

That doesn't appear to be true.

""The committee tested that hypothesis in five different ways,"" said Kennedy. ""And each test yielded either no evidence whatsoever to support that hypothesis or weak evidence.""

If there were this ""shy Trump voter"" effect, the authors wrote, there should be some sort of evidence that robopolls (that is, automated phone polls) and Internet polls consistently showed Trump doing better than the phone polls, for example. That didn't happen. Robopolls did tend to show Trump with better support than in live-phone polls, but Internet-only polls tended to show him doing worse.

One other issue that didn't seem to matter much was ""nonresponse bias."" This is the idea that certain groups will respond to polls more often than others, thus biasing the results. There's a reason survey researchers worry about this: People participate in phone polls far less often than they did in the past.

As explained above, some groups (like less educated Americans) often participate in polls less than others. But when the researchers broke this down by geography, they did not find that pro-Trump areas were any less likely to be represented, on average, than pro-Clinton areas. Furthermore, they didn't find that the relatively correct national polls were right just because Clinton- and Trump-favoring polls nationwide canceled each other out.

What now?

Though many 2016 polls were indeed off, the authors hope it won't sour Americans on polling altogether. ""The difficulties for election polls in 2016 are not an indictment on all of survey research or even all of polling,"" the report said.

They also voiced some anger about the fact that a few bad polls can make all pollsters look bad.

""It is a persistent frustration within polling and the larger survey research community that the profession is judged based on how these often under-budgeted state polls perform relative to the election outcome,"" they wrote.

For that reason, they propose a greater investment in state-level polling: ""Well-resourced survey organizations might have enough common interest in financing some high quality state-level polls so as to reduce the likelihood of another black eye for the profession.""

And one more thing: The researchers wag a collective finger at election forecasters, saying that ""they helped crystalize the belief that Clinton was a shoo-in for president, with unknown consequences for turnout.""

What to do about that is unclear — even some of the people producing those forecasts advised caution. The pollsters even point to a quote from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver in this regard.

""It's irresponsible to blame the polls for the overconfidence in Clinton's chances,"" he said. ""They showed a competitive, uncertain race.""

"Nations waged campaigns of influence against each other for centuries before Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and nothing is likely to stop them anytime soon.

Congress could mandate more ""disclosure"" for foreigners buying ads on U.S. social networks, but that wouldn't stop the ads from being sold, nor would it address the covert part of the Russians' playbook — the cyberattacks, snooping and dumping of embarrassing information.

The U.S. has already increased sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the election interference — with no effect so far on its ongoing campaign of active measures. Personal warnings by then-President Obama and then-CIA Director John Brennan to their Russian counterparts during the 2016 election cycle didn't move the needle either.

This is cold comfort for policymakers now, but they're only the latest group of leaders in Washington, D.C., to try to tackle this issue.

""Soviet intelligence officers have already started to collect information on the 1988 presidential candidates and their positions on various issues,"" the FBI warned in a 1987 report.

""It is possible that the Soviet Union will institute a new series of active measures operations designed to discredit those candidates who have platforms that are not acceptable to the Soviet government,"" the report also said.

The Bureau cited work it had already done in discrediting a forged Russian document from three years before.

""The forgery, dated 1947, purported that Ronald Reagan was working in collusion with the FBI and the House Committee on Un-American Activities concerning Communist infiltration into the Hollywood film world. This forgery was designed to discredit President Reagan by raising the issue of 'McCarthyism' during an election year,' "" the report explained.

National security leaders and members of Congress in Washington have been hearing very similar mood music over the past year. Then-FBI Director James Comey is said to have grappled with a document that purportedly described then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch reassuring the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton that Lynch would go easy on them over Clinton's emails and private server.

That document, which Comey and the FBI have declined to discuss, has been described as a U.S. intelligence intercept of Russian government message traffic. Comey knew it was fake, as The Washington Post reported, but it nonetheless muddied the waters he was trying to navigate and has since raised doubts about his decision.

For the authors of these active measures, that means a success — the way they always have.

""One way to think about Soviet efforts is to think of them as the activities of a giant political action committee,"" said Robert M. Gates, then deputy director of the CIA for Intelligence. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about active measures on Sept. 12, 1985, in a closed session that has since been partially declassified.

""This Soviet political action committee has an impressive set of resources,"" Gates said. He continued: ""A large budget; a cadre of experienced campaign strategists and activists; its own massive public relations organization; freedom from any constraints on disclosure of activities; willingness of those it opposes; and an ability to place covert agents within opposing organizations.""

Gates and his colleagues likely had had an easier time of it in their day. There was no global Internet with billions of users, no cyber-weapons and no social networks. The opponent they faced was actively interested in exporting its own political dogma.

Now, technology gives influence-mongers in any nation many orders of magnitude more avenues by which to spread their messages. And in the case of Russia, it no longer wants to convert capitalists into fellow travelers in the cause of Communism.

Instead, it has the simpler and potentially more pernicious goal of simply taking the West down a peg, sowing chaos and corroding faith in democracy.

""In the wake of Russia's attack on the 2016 election, it is more important than ever to strengthen our defenses against foreign interference in our elections,"" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement earlier this month.

He and Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., are sponsoring a bill that they say would help defeat some active measures. It would require that ads sold to foreign buyers on big social networks — especially Facebook — disclose who'd paid for them and that the social networks would have to disclose to anyone the content of the ads.

""I have long fought to increase transparency and end the corrupting influence of special interests in political campaigns, and I am confident this legislation will modernize existing law to safeguard the integrity of our election system,"" McCain said as the introduced the bill.

But the bill wouldn't do anything about automated Twitter accounts amplifying controversy, or foreign agitators organizing rallies, or cyberattacks or any of the other weapons at the disposal of contemporary agents of influence. And a foreign government doesn't need to try to get inside the United States to raise doubts about events on the world scene.

Back in 1987, then-spymaster Gates told his Senate interlocutors about Moscow's plan to raise doubts about the incident in which a Soviet interceptor shot down a Korean civilian airliner that strayed into Russian airspace, killing 269 people. There was no question that the Soviets had destroyed the aircraft, but as Gates said, the U.S.S.R. needed there to be.

""In some cases, all the Soviets are interested in is raising doubt about an issue,"" he said, ""the Soviets probably never realistically expected to reverse public opinion in their favor, but to create enough public doubt to make it responsible to voice the other side of the issue. And they did that.""

Moscow returned to the same playbook when it circulated alternate explanations for the 2014 destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was destroyed by a Russian surface-to-air missile fired from pro-Russian territory in Ukraine.

Leaders in D.C. approaching the end of the Cold War debated how much to worry about active measures and what action to take in response. One strategy was to attempt to fight disinformation with more information in publicly calling out forgeries or other false stories.

Gates told senators that it was ""often difficult to determine the precise effects"" of Russian influence activities and that the work of Russia's intelligence and other agencies ""do not guarantee success.""

That's when Gates — who went on to become director of the CIA and secretary of defense — said something that resonates closely with life in Washington now: ""In a close election or legislative battle, they can spell the difference.""

"Here's the paradox with international news.

In our wired and rapidly shrinking world, there is no distant war, no isolated economic crisis and no social trend that observes national borders.

When a building collapses in Bangladesh, photos of the dead and grieving appear instantly. When a battle takes place in Syria, YouTube videos surface in real time. You can even get tweets from North Korea.

Yet all this technological wizardry can easily become a confusing cacophony, a discordant electronic buzz that has erupted at a time when many American news organizations have retreated from international coverage. There's no substitute for having a reporter at the scene, and yet they have become increasingly scarce.

But NPR has been bucking that trend. We have reporters around the world who are willing to go anywhere to find a good story and explain what it means. And they are the reason we are launching this blog.

Our correspondents won't just be reporting the news, they will be looking to tell stories that connect us all. They will be seeking out, well, parallels, between stories far away and those close to home. And in the process, we hope to offer up some uncommon answers and alternate perspectives.

So many stories cross borders and we have the reporters to cover them at both ends. After the bombing at the Boston Marathon, the focus of the story soon moved to the family roots of the suspects, who came from the Caucasus region in southern Russia. NPR's Corey Flintoff was there to help explain the complicated history of this troubled territory.

As we begin the blog this week, our reporters will be taking you from Africa to Asia as we look at the increasingly sophisticated nature of international poaching. South Africa has the largest number of rhinos, and the best protected. Yet high-tech poachers are slaughtering them by the hundreds for their horns. The destination may surprise you: it's often Vietnam, where the newly emerging rich are prepared to spend big money in the misguided notion that these horns can cure everything from hangovers to cancer.

"Children all over the United States will have a big decision to make on Christmas Eve: Would Santa Claus prefer a chocolate chip cookie for a snack or perhaps a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

The American tradition of leaving a snack for Santa on Christmas Eve is said by some to date to the Great Depression, when parents wanted to teach their children the value of giving selflessly to others. However, it's also plausible that, in a country populated by immigrants from all over the world, our tradition is simply one brought over from the Old Country — or, more accurately, Old Countries.

Along with a bevy of far-flung food experts, Washington, D.C.'s local diplomatic community is a particularly good source of information about what Santa is eating around the world — and it would appear that Jolly Old St. Nick is quite well-fed long before he reaches our shores.

Kate Reuterswärd, press officer at the Embassy of Sweden in Washington, D.C., has fond memories of leaving a bowl of rice porridge, called risgrynsgröt, outside the door of her family's home for the Jultomte, or Swedish Santa. ""Unlike the American Santa, the Jultomte enters your house through the front door, not through the chimney, so that's why the porridge is left there,"" says Reuterswärd. ""The rice porridge is thickened with milk and flavored with cinnamon and a little salt. Some families add almonds, butter, jam, or molasses, but the traditional version doesn't have to be sweetened.""

For Swedish Ambassador Karin Olofsdotter, the rice porridge was certainly a traditional offering, but her family always left a cheese and butter sandwich outside the door, along with a carrot for the reindeer. In the morning, she says, ""The sandwich was always gone, and there would be a gnawed carrot stub left.""

When passing through Italy, Babbo Natale (aka Santa Claus) gets a clementine from children — and some hay for his donkey, because reindeer are not always his chosen mode of transportation. But a few weeks earlier, on Dec. 6, St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children, gets a clementine and a glass of wine, while leaving gifts for kids on St. Nicholas Day.

In fact, while milk may be the beverage of choice here in the U.S., Santa seems to imbibe more potent liquids before arriving in the lower 48 — and he probably does need a nonalcoholic alternative by then. British diplomat Andrew Overton notes that ""British children will often leave out a mince pie and a nip of sherry to brace Father Christmas for the chill."" In Ireland, things get jollier with a pint of Guinness (and that splash of whiskey that Mrs. Claus has ready when Santa gets home). And apparently the Norwegian Nisse — a precursor to the Julenisse, Norway's Santa — will cause a lot of trouble if a jug of beer isn't provided with his rice pudding on Christmas Eve.

The Christmas Eve drinking gets its start Down Under, on Santa's first stop.

""I think Australian customs are quite close to [America's],"" says food historian Barbara Santich of the University of Adelaide, ""except that it might be a bottle of beer or glass of sherry or wine instead of milk,"" perhaps accompanied by a bit of fruitcake, which is usually also laden with whiskey or rum.

Of course, it's summer in December south of the equator, so a cold beer hardly seems out of place. Nor does a bit of barbecue in South Africa, or fufu with egusi — a West African seafood and meat soup — in Nigeria.

Once Santa gets to South America a bit later in the evening, there's pan de pascua to look forward to, a traditional Chilean Christmas fruitcake made with dulce de leche. Food blogger Pilar Hernandez acknowledges that the word ""pascua"" can be confusing in the context of Christmas, with its reference to Easter and ""pascal."" ""In Chile, Christmas is called Pascua, Santa Claus is El Viejo Pascuero and so on. Easter is Pascua also, but Pascua de Resurrección. Don't get lost in the name; this is a fruitcake that will change you for the better.""

But Santa isn't greeted with snacks everywhere. In Iceland, he is the one who does the feeding. Christmas Eve is the night when the first of 13 – 13! — different Icelandic Santas arrive, over the course of 13 days, to bring apples, oranges or other treats. ""Children leave their shoes in the window and hope to get something in their shoe, after behaving especially good prior to him arriving,"" says Gudbjorg Bjarnadottir Ozgun, consular affairs officer at the Embassy of Iceland.

Santa is probably grateful not to have to nibble snacks in Iceland after all the rice pudding he has already eaten throughout Scandinavia. In Germany, Switzerland and El Salvador, he'll have letters to read instead, filled with children's wishes and dreams. And in Latvia, both children and adults are required to recite a poem in front of the Christmas tree in order to earn a gift, according to Latvian diplomat Artūrs Saburovs — although Father Christmas might snag a piparkukas, a spicy holiday gingerbread cookie made with white pepper, before heading on to the next stop on his global excursion.

Once he arrives on American soil, Santa will likely find a variety of offerings, from pizza to ants on a log — or perhaps even some nourishing bone broth or an energizing Red Bull.

And as for those cookies and milk: Cookbook author CiCi Williamson, who spent 26 years as a food safety expert for the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline, cautions against leaving that milk out for too long. ""Milk left out all night could make Santa ill from a foodborne illness,"" she says. ""Milk shouldn't be left out more than two hours. After that, bacteria double in numbers every 20 minutes.""

Let's not slow Santa down with tummy trouble. Maybe a nice glass of water will do. And don't forget a bucket for those thirsty reindeer, too.

"Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, questions then-FBI Director James Comey during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3.

Fired FBI Director James Comey may tell the Senate Intelligence Committee next week that President Trump suggested he ease off at least part of the FBI's Russia investigation.

But a month ago, he said this to the Senate Judiciary Committee: ""I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.""

Why did Comey say he has never been asked to stop an investigation for political reasons after that conversation with Trump?

Some writers on the Internet, particularly Comey critics, have a couple of simple explanations — the memos are fake or he perjured himself in front of Congress.

But there's more context. Here is the full exchange from the Judiciary Committee hearing, when Comey was being questioned by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii.

HIRONO: So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?

COMEY: In theory, yes.

HIRONO: Has it happened?

COMEY: Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that — without an appropriate purpose. I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that ""we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it."" But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.

Hirono's question was very specific — referring to ""the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice"" — and not the president. There's been no indication that officials at the Justice Department applied pressure to Comey to stop any part of the Russia investigation.

What we have learned from Comey associates is that he wrote a memo shortly after a private meeting with Trump in February, in which Comey recounted Trump saying, ""I hope you can let this go."" This was just after national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after misleading Vice President Pence and others regarding his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Trump's comment to Comey was said to refer to the investigation of Flynn as part of the FBI's larger Russia probe. As NPR's Carrie Johnson reported, Comey recalled giving a nonresponse and wrote a ""very, very detailed"" memo to recount the meeting shortly after. Comey is known to keep such memos to record important professional episodes, like the night in 2004 when he stopped senior members of the Bush administration from reauthorizing the domestic surveillance program without proper approval.

Congress wants to see Comey's memos regarding his meetings with Trump. In legal proceedings, such contemporaneous notes can hold a lot of credibility. But the White House has vehemently denied Trump ever said anything that would pressure Comey to back off of Flynn or the larger Russia investigation.

""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official said in a statement. ""The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.""

It seemed to some that Comey's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee just before he was fired may have affirmed the White House's position, because that quote was often heard without the question. When Comey re-emerges in public before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, he could well be asked whether he was lying in his earlier testimony.

But given Hirono's wording and Comey's well-known attention to detail, he may simply say that he was answering the question he was asked.

"Updated at 9:14 p.m. ET

The office of special counsel Robert Mueller removed an FBI agent from the team investigating Russia's interference in last year's election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the Washington Post and the New York Times both reported Saturday.

Agent Peter Strzok exchanged politically-charged text messages with Lisa Page, who was also a member of Mueller's investigative team at the time; the messages expressed anti-Trump views, according to both newspapers.

I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!

""Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel's Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,"" Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, said in a statement. ""Lisa Page completed her brief detail and had returned to the FBI weeks before our office was aware of the allegations.""

Separately, a Justice Department spokeswoman said, ""we are aware of the allegations and are taking any and all appropriate steps.""

Strzok was removed from Mueller's team during the summer of this year and has since been assigned to the FBI's human resources department, according to the newspapers. Page is a lawyer for the bureau who once worked for FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe but no longer does much work for McCabe, the Post reported. In addition to both having worked on Mueller's probe, Strzok and Page also both had roles in the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, according to the Post.

After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.

The reports of Strzok's removal came just a day after Mueller's team revealed a plea deal with Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser.

Given Flynn's proximity to Trump during last year's presidential race and to Trump's inner circle until his ouster in February of this year, the agreement with Flynn and his cooperation in the Mueller probe signaled to many observers that the Justice Department's investigation has entered a new phase — with a possible focus on those closest to the president or perhaps even Donald Trump himself.

Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense!

Speaking Saturday about Flynn's plea deal, the president reiterated that there had been no coordination between his campaign and Russia. ""What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion,"" Trump said, ""There's been absolutely no collusion, so we're very happy.""

Despite his assertions throughout this year that there was no wrongdoing by himself or anyone associated with his campaign, Trump has been critical of Mueller's probe and the FBI generally. The president has also continued his longstanding criticism of the FBI's Clinton email server investigation which Trump initially cited as his reason for firing FBI Director James Comey in May of this year.

Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.” Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.

""Among federal law enforcement officials, there is great concern that exposure of the texts [Strzok and Page] exchanged may be used by the president and his defenders to attack the credibility of the Mueller probe, and the FBI more broadly,"" the Post wrote Saturday. And both the Times and the Post noted in their reports that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has faced criticism from Trump and other Republicans for his role in the Clinton email investigation and his wife's political ties to a key Clinton ally in Virginia.

Indeed, the FBI has already become a target of Republicans as the Russia imbroglio unfolds. In late October, the GOP chairmen of the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committees announced a joint inquiry into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email server investigation.

The Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General is already conducting a review of actions of the DOJ and the FBI during last year's election and it said Saturday that the revelations about Strzok and Page would be included in that review. ""The OIG has been reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals, and will report its findings regarding those allegations promptly upon completion of the review of them,"" the inspector general's office said in a statement provided to NPR.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a statement Saturday night, as did the FBI's Office of Public Affairs.

""The allegations that the Inspector General has confirmed are part of his ongoing investigation, if proven to be true, would raise serious questions of public trust,"" Sessions said. ""I look forward to receiving the Inspector General's report. We will ensure that anyone who works on any investigation in the Department of Justice does so objectively and free from bias or favoritism.""

Sessions also said he has directed FBI Director Christopher Wray to ""review the information available on this and other matters and promptly make any necessary changes to his management and investigative teams consistent with the highest professional standards.""

""The matter is an ongoing investigation by the Office of Inspector General, consistent with well-established processes designed to objectively, thoroughly and fairly determine the facts regarding potential wrongdoing,"" the FBI said. The bureau added that it ""holds all of its employees to the highest standards of integrity, independence and professionalism, as the American public rightly expects.""

Attempts by the Times and the Post to reach Strzok and Page were unsuccessful. ""A lawyer for Mr. Strzok declined to comment,"" the Times reported. The Post reported it ""has repeatedly sought comment from Strzok and Page, but got no response.""

"Updated at 8:19 p.m. ET

Former FBI Director James Comey has agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in an open session.

""The Committee looks forward to receiving testimony from the former Director on his role in the development of the Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, and I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,"" Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said in a statement released Friday evening.

""I hope that former Director Comey's testimony will help answer some of the questions that have arisen since Director Comey was so suddenly dismissed by the President. I also expect that Director Comey will be able to shed light on issues critical to this Committee's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election,"" said Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va. ""Director Comey served his country with honor for many years, and he deserves an opportunity to tell his story. Moreover, the American people deserve an opportunity to hear it.""

Comey's highly anticipated testimony, which will be slated after the Memorial Day congressional recess, comes after he was fired by Trump May 9 amid a mounting investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and possible ties between Trump campaign associates and that country.

Comey, however, turned down an invitation to testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee as well, which left chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., ""extremely disappointed,"" the lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

""There is no reason he can't testify before both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, particularly given that the Judiciary Committee is the FBI's primary oversight committee with broad jurisdiction over federal law enforcement, FISA and the nomination of the next FBI director,"" the two senators also said. ""Given his commitment to the people and the mission of the FBI, we expected him to be responsive to the senators responsible for vetting its next proposed leader. He should reconsider his decision.""

While the White House initially pointed to a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, outlining Comey's mismanagement of the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's private email server, as the impetus for his termination, Trump later admitted that the Russia investigation — which he has called a ""hoax"" — played a role.

Earlier on Friday, the New York Times reported that Trump told Russian officials the day after he fired Comey that the former FBI director was a ""nut job"" and he had let him go to take off the ""great pressure"" around the mounting investigation.

Earlier this week, NPR confirmed that Trump had asked Comey to scuttle the investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, according to a memo of the account written by Comey. Trump has denied that ever happened.

On Wednesday, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to take over and continue the Justice Department investigation into Russian election interference and possible links with Trump campaign aides.

"A new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists says that at least 42 journalists worldwide were killed in 2017 in retaliation for their work — which marks a drop from the 48 killed last year.

But one country defied what appears to be a downward trend — Mexico.

According to the New York-based nonprofit, six journalists were killed in Mexico this year, putting it just behind Iraq and Syria as the deadliest places in the world to work in the media.

Another reporter may be added to Mexico's murdered list for 2017. On Tuesday, Gumaro Pérez Aguilando was killed in the state of Veracruz. The 35-year-old crime reporter was gunned down while attending a Christmas party at his son's elementary school.

Pérez was registered in the state's journalist protection program. But Wednesday, state investigators said he was no longer a working journalist and had ties to organized crime. That drew an angry protest by the secretary of the state's Commission for the Attention and Protection of Journalists.

""A discussion of a person's character, with the intention to judge him and criminalize him, does not help those of us who desire justice for journalists who have been assassinated,"" said Jorge Morales Vázquez.

Outside of conflict zones, Mexico takes the No. 1 spot for journalists murdered in 2017. The CPJ is investigating 20 other killings possibly related to journalists' work but so far no connections have been made.

""The rise in the number of journalists murdered in Mexico in retaliation for their work is terrible news and suggests that the Mexican government has failed in its public commitments to end the culture of impunity,"" says Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.

Mexican officials say they are working to stop the murders. They point to a federal protection program for media workers that provides bodyguards and even ""panic buttons"" to summon police in case of danger. But journalists enrolled in the program say it doesn't work and is inadequate for the threat they face.

Organized crime gangs and corrupt officials offended by reporters' coverage are believed to be behind the killings. With few cases resolved, it is difficult to say for sure who is behind the murders.

The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders says the number of reporters killed in Mexico is higher, putting the figure at 11 this year. Local press freedom groups put the number even beyond that. Each group has different criteria to determine whether a media worker was killed in retaliation for his or her profession.

Many reporters in Mexico have been forced out of the profession or have opted to self-censor. Many more vow to fight on despite the threats. Most at risk are reporters working for small outlets, far from Mexico City.

That was not the case, however, in the murder of Miroslava Breach, who covered crime and corruption as a correspondent for the national newspaper La Jornada in the northern state of Chihuahua. Breach was killed on March 23. Gunmen shot her in her car as she pulled out of her driveway, with one of her three children sitting next to her. At the time, reporter Javier Valdez, one of Mexico's most acclaimed chroniclers of the country's drug war, defiantly wrote about Breach's killers.

""Let them kill us all, if that is the death penalty for reporting this hell, No to silence,"" he wrote.

Less than two months later, Valdez was pulled from his car and murdered in the street just blocks from the offices of his newspaper Riodoce in Culiacán, Sinaloa. No one has been charged in the case of either Breach or Valdez.

"Updated at 3:15 p.m. ET.

FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday defended his decision to tell Congress in October that he was revisiting the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said he believed revisiting the investigation just before the election — knowing it could affect the outcome — would be really bad, but that not to do so would be catastrophic for the agency's independence. In retrospect, he said, he still believes he made the right choice.

""Look, this was terrible. It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election. But honestly, it wouldn't change the decision,"" he said.

Comey's remarks were his first public comment on his decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation, which came after FBI agents discovered new communications connected to the former secretary of state's private server. Comey's letter to congressional leaders informing them of the action was immediately leaked, and Clinton says it contributed to her loss on Election Day.

Wednesday's testimony by Comey came during what was intended to be a routine oversight hearing of the FBI, but was instead dominated by questions relating to investigations surrounding the 2016 campaign.

Senators also asked Comey about Russia. He said Russia represents ""the greatest threat of any nation on Earth, given their intention and capability.""

He insisted that the FBI's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and the possible links between Trump campaign and Russian officials are being treated ""consistently under the same principles"" as the Clinton email probe. He said the bureau ""didn't say a word"" about the Russia-Trump probe ""until months into it,"" and that he expects ""we're not gonna say another peep about it until we're done."" He insisted that was the way the bureau handled the Clinton investigation as well.

The repercussions from Comey's action continue to reverberate across the political spectrum. At a forum in New York on Tuesday, Clinton said Comey's letter to Congress on Oct. 28 was a factor in her loss to President Trump. ""If the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president,"" she said, while also putting responsibility for her loss on her own actions.

Trump tweeted later Tuesday night that Comey ""was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds.""

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...

Comey said being in the middle of — if not creating — a political firestorm has taken a toll. ""Lordy, has this been painful,"" he told committee members. ""I've gotten all kinds of rocks thrown at me, and this has been really hard, but I think I've done the right thing at each turn.""

Comey also disclosed that he has been interviewed by the Justice Department's Inspector General Office, which is conducing its own investigation into how the FBI handled the Clinton email probe. Comey said he welcomed the review.

Comey was asked if he was looking into whether FBI agents may have leaked information about the Clinton investigation. Trump adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said former agents had told him in advance of the reopening of the Clinton email investigation. Comey said if he finds out people leaked information about FBI investigations, ""there will be severe consequences.""

He was also asked the difference between journalism, protected under the first amendment, and WikiLeaks. Comey said that to his mind, ""it crosses a line when it moves from being about trying to educate a public and instead just becomes about intelligence porn, frankly, just pushing out information about sources and methods without regard to interests.""

"Sheriff's deputies in York County, Neb., stopped a pickup truck on Tuesday when they noticed it driving over the center line and the driver failing to signal.

During the traffic stop, deputies noticed a strong smell of raw marijuana, the sheriff's department says. 

Patrick Jiron, 80, and Barbara Jiron, 83, said they were from northern California and were en route to Boston and Vermont.

Deputies asked the driver, Patrick Jiron, about the odor, and he admitted to having contraband in the truck and consented to a search of the vehicle.

With the help of the county's canine unit, deputies searched the Toyota Tacoma. When they looked under the pickup topper, deputies found 60 pounds of marijuana, as well as multiple containers of concentrated THC.

""They said the marijuana was for Christmas presents,"" Lt. Paul Vrbka told the York News-Times. The department estimated the street value of the pot at over $3oo,000.

The Jirons now face felony charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver and no drug tax stamp. (Nebraska law requires marijuana dealers to purchase drug tax stamp from its Department of Revenue as evidence that the state's drug tax has been paid.)

For the friends and family in New England who expected a bag of weed in their stocking this year, it looks like it won't be a green Christmas, after all.

"Updated on Sunday at 12:25 a.m. ET

President Trump told the White House press corps Saturday that he had had several brief conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific summit the two men were attending in Vietnam. During those conversations, Putin once again denied any interference in last year's election, Trump said. And, the president said, he believed that Putin believed there was no interference.

""He said he didn't meddle,"" Trump said aboard Air Force One when asked whether he had discussed Russia's interference in the 2016 election with Putin. ""He said he didn't meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.""

""He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did,"" Trump added.

Later on Sunday in Hanoi, and after receiving criticism for his remarks, Trump was asked for clarification on the topic. Trump responded that he agrees with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in last year's election.

""I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,"" he told reporters. ""As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership.""

Putin has repeatedly denied that the Russian government had any role in interfering in the 2016 presidential race. But the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia did interfere, with an eye toward boosting Trump's political chances and damaging Hillary Clinton's. And CIA Director Mike Pompeo stands by the community's assessment, CNN reported. ""The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed,"" the CIA said in a statement, according to CNN.

The latest conversation about the issue between Trump and Putin comes at a delicate time for the White House. Nearly two weeks ago, Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller unsealed a plea deal with George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign. Those court documents revealed contacts between Papadopoulos and Russians, including efforts by Papadopoulos to arrange meetings between officials of the campaign and representatives of the Russian government.

And Carter Page, another former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, recently testified before the House Intelligence Committee about his contacts with Russians during his tenure with the campaign.

J.D. Gordon, another foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, recently characterized both Papadopolous and Page as ""peripheral members of a relatively peripheral advisory committee"" to the campaign.

But the recent revelations about Russian contacts with the campaign's foreign policy team have already caused some fallout for the administration. A onetime Trump campaign official withdrew his nomination for a post at the Department of Agriculture, in part because he was likely to face questions about the campaign's contacts with Russia during his confirmation hearing. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions is expected to once again face questions about Russia and the Trump campaign at a congressional oversight hearing next week.

Asked Saturday whether he believes Putin's denials, President Trump initially suggested the question of election interference needed to be set aside to focus on other concerns. ""Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him,"" Trump said. ""I would rather have him get out of Syria; I would rather get to work ... on the Ukraine."" And, ""he could really help us on North Korea,"" Trump pointed out.

But Trump also told reporters that he accepts the sincerity of Putin's repeated assertions that the Russian government did not interfere in last year's election. ""Every time he sees me he says, 'I didn't do that,' and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,"" Trump also said. ""I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country,"" Trump added.

With multiple ongoing investigations into Russia's interference in the election, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, the White House is sensitive about any formal sit-down with Putin. Trump told reporters on his way to Asia that he thought a meeting with the Russian president was expected. But White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said scheduling conflicts made such a meeting impossible.

Trump complained Saturday that attention to Russia's interference had created what he called an ""artificial barrier"" to doing business with Putin.

""Having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing, especially as it relates to North Korea,"" Trump told reporters. ""It would take a lot of danger out of this world. It's a dangerous time — this isn't small stuff.""

Trump said he and Putin did not have time to discuss North Korea during their brief conversations over the weekend.

Trump's remarks set off a round of criticism.

""There's nothing 'America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community,"" frequent Trump foil Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement. ""Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart,"" McCain added, ""To believe otherwise is not only naive but also places our national security at risk.""

""You know who else is insulted by it, Mr. President? The American people,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on Twitter, ""You believe a foreign adversary over your own intelligence agencies.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., was equally blunt. ""We must all call this what it is: absolute betrayal. Betrayal of those who serve us and betrayal of the oath to defend our democracy,"" Swalwell posted on Twitter. The lawmaker is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and ranking member of its Subcommittee on the CIA and is a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

And legendary broadcast journalist Tom Brokaw asked on Twitter ""Where is GOP outrage?""

pres trump on foreign soil calling 3 u.s. intel professionals “political hacks” while praising Putinand believing his denial of Russian elect interference.where is GOP outrage?

As he frequently does, the president used Twitter to respond to the criticism as he began his day Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam. ""Progress being made,"" Trump said of his discussions with Putin. Then, Trump turned to his critics, calling them ""haters and fools.""

When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!

Trump also mentioned ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" and her effort to improve relations with Russia while secretary of state. And, Trump said, ""Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.""

Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.

The president also told reporters Saturday that his conversations with Putin mainly concerned Syria. He and Putin later issued a joint statement reiterating their determination to defeat ISIS in Syria, as well as their commitment to a political solution to that country's long-running civil war.

The statement says in part:

""The Presidents agreed that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria. They confirmed that the ultimate political solution to the conflict must be forged through the Geneva process pursuant to UNSCR 2254. They also took note of President [Assad's] recent commitment to the Geneva process and constitutional reform and elections as called for under UNSCR 2254.""

"In the thick of the presidential race last summer — Donald Trump was attacking Hillary Clinton over Benghazi; Clinton was widening her lead in the polls — FBI agents uncovered something odd.

On June 28, federal cyber experts noticed that the network credentials of an Arizona county elections worker had been posted on a site frequented by suspected Russian hackers. The password and username discovered by the FBI could let someone access the state's voter registration system.

Two weeks later, Illinois' state Board of Elections IT staff noticed a startling spike in activity involving their voter registration system. Malicious queries were hitting it 5 times per second, 24 hours a day, looking for a way to break in.

The Illinois state officials took their website offline. They discovered to their surprise that the attack had begun three weeks earlier and originated from somewhere overseas.

Both incidents were a wake-up call for an increasingly nervous cybersecurity and elections community. A couple of weeks before, hackers tied to the Russian government broke into the Democratic National Committee's computer system and stole thousands of sensitive documents.

The U.S. intelligence community determined that Russian intelligence gave them to WikiLeaks, which then released them to the public. The resulting controversy helped lead to the resignation of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and kicked off a summer of much more cyber-intrigue.

For all the focus on the public saga over the Democrats, Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta and other cyberattacks that dominated the 2016 election, less attention was paid to what was happening in states such as Arizona and Illinois.

In both cases, state and federal officials say that the foreign attacks ultimately didn't compromise any voter records — although in Illinois, hackers did gain access to the personal information of almost 76,000 registered voters before the state installed new security.

But the precise details about what did take place in the states attacked by Russia's intelligence services aren't fully known. Federal agencies, along with state and local election officials, struggled over the following months to figure out how to protect the American voting process from tampering, and to keep public confidence in elections from eroding.

Here's a look at what is known about how events unfolded over an election like no other.

2016

Early August: President Obama and three top aides receive a top secret report from the CIA detailing a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to disrupt the U.S. election, including the use of cyberattacks. The president directs aides to look into vulnerabilities in election systems and what can be done to protect against tampering.

Aug. 3: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson tells reporters that he's considering designating elections as ""critical infrastructure."" This would give the agency more leeway to provide cybersecurity assistance and intelligence information to state and local election officials. But state officials worry this might lead to more federal involvement in elections, which are traditionally run by state and local governments.

Aug. 5: The National Association of Secretaries of State, which represents top election officials in most states, releases a statement assuring voters that ""hacking of the election is highly improbable due to our unique, decentralized process."" They also note extensive security measures states have already taken to prevent hacking of voting equipment.

Aug. 15: Amid growing concerns that Russians are tampering with the election, DHS Secretary Johnson holds a conference call with state election officials. He offers more security assistance, but states are increasingly nervous that the federal government will try to tell them how to run their elections. It's a tense relationship that continues well into 2017.

Aug. 18:  The FBI issues a flash alert telling election officials and vendors to be on the lookout for hacking attempts coming from a list of IP addresses involved in the Arizona and Illinois attacks. States start checking their computer systems for evidence of unauthorized intrusions. It's later determined that at least 21 states were targeted.

Aug. 24: Hackers, later linked to Russian military intelligence, launch a cyberattack against a Florida-based elections software vendor, VR Systems. The company provides voter registration systems to local election offices. According to a National Security Agency report leaked the following June, the hackers try to gain the email credentials of several VR Systems employees. The company says they did not succeed, although the NSA says it's ""likely that at least one account was compromised.""

Aug. 31:  DHS sets up an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with state officials to share threat information and advice on countering efforts to tamper with their election systems.

Sept. 28:  The bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate sides with local election officials by coming out against the DHS plan to designate elections as critical infrastructure. ""For over 200 years the states have overcome every challenge to ensure the smooth function of our democracy,"" they wrote.

Sept. 30:  The FBI holds a conference call with the supervisors of all 67 Florida counties to warn of hacking attempts involving a local vendor. This appears to be a reference to VR Systems, which provides services throughout the state.

Oct. 7: DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issue a joint statement confirming that the Russian government is behind the recent hacks of DNC and other party computer systems. They also say that recent scanning and probing of state election systems ""originated from servers operated by a Russian company,"" although they add that they are not ready ""to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.""

Oct. 10: DHS announces that 33 states, as well as some local election agencies, have asked for cybersecurity assistance, but Secretary Johnson warns others that they should seek help soon. ""Time is a factor,"" he said. ""There are only 29 days until Election Day.""

Oct. 27: Hackers linked to Russian military intelligence create a fake email account, pretending to be from elections software vendor VR Systems. They then use that account to send emails containing malicious software to up to 122 local government offices involved in managing voter registration systems. The NSA finds no evidence that any of the phony emails are opened.

Nov. 8: Federal intelligence and security officials monitor voting from a command center in Washington, D.C. They have a detailed response plan in the event that a severe cyberattack disrupts the election. It involves such drastic steps as sending in military forces to secure facilities, if necessary. But there's no need. Voting proceeds without serious incident. Although in Durham County, N.C., electronic pollbooks used to check in voters malfunction and the county decides to use paper registration lists instead.

Dec. 9: The Washington Post reports that the CIA has concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help get Trump elected, not merely to undermine public confidence. The president-elect's transition team dismisses the findings, saying in a statement, ""It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great again.'"" President Obama orders the intelligence community to review all election-related hacking incidents and report back to him before he leaves office.

Dec. 29: The Obama administration issues new sanctions against Russia for interfering in U.S. elections, and orders the expulsion of 35 Russian operatives.

2017

Jan. 6: The U.S intelligence community releases a report detailing its assessment of Russian interference in the elections by sowing misinformation and hacking into computer networks. After being briefed, President-elect Trump notes that ""there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines."" Despite continued opposition from state officials, DHS Secretary Johnson designates elections as critical infrastructure.

March 20: FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers tell the House Intelligence Committee that there's no evidence of any votes being changed by Russian hackers. But both men say they fully expect the Russians will attempt to influence future U.S. elections. ""I think we have to assume they're coming back,"" says Comey.

June 5: The online news site, The Intercept, reveals the NSA report concluding that Russian military intelligence attempted to hack into VR Systems and launched a spear-phishing campaign involving more than 100 local election offices. NSA contractor Reality Winner is arrested for releasing the document to the news site. State election officials express anger that they learned about the cyberattack from the news media, and not from federal authorities.

June 21: Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, DHS official Samuel Liles says his agency determined in September 2016 that election-related systems in 21 states were targeted by Russia. Again, he says there's no evidence any votes were changed, but lawmakers express frustration that federal agencies have released few details about the hacking attempts to the public, including the identifies of the targeted states. State officials testify that they are unaware if they are on the list.

"At 1:30 a.m. on June 17, sailors on the USS Fitzgerald were jolted awake in their bunks. Some were thrown to the floor. Their guided missile destroyer had just collided with a cargo ship off the coast of Japan.

A gaping hole was gashed into their living quarters, two levels below deck, and they were engulfed in a rush of cold seawater.

""It's coming in in torrents. So there's currents and it's beginning to swirl, so mattresses are being picked up, pillows are picked up. Anything that's loose. Tables, chairs are beginning to swirl around,"" said Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain at the Center for a New American Security who has studied the Navy's detailed account of the collision.

""And it's all occurring in the dark,"" he said. ""It's chaos.""

Within a minute, the water in the living quarters was waist-deep. Moments later, it reached the ceiling.

The report lays out how the sailors helped each other. Only one rescuer is mentioned by name: Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Rehm Jr.

""He was always the first one to run to something,"" said Erin Rehm, his widow. With tears running down her cheeks, she shared memories of her husband at her in-laws' kitchen table in Williamsburg, Va.

""It wasn't just his shipmates. He was like that with everybody. If any of my friends were in trouble or needed something, he was like, 'Oh, you have car trouble. Let me see what I can do. Bring your car over,'"" she said. ""That's just what he did. He was Mr. Fix-It.""

No matter where in the world he was, Rehm called Erin daily.

""The gist of our conversations were the same every day,"" she said. ""How much I loved him and missed him. I mean, it was just normal, silly conversation. We were just very goofy together, always laughing. I think there were probably about three 'I love you's' before he hung up, because that was pretty common for us.""

A father figure

At 37, Rehm was a veteran on the ship. He called his younger shipmates his kids. Rehm invited them to holiday meals with Erin at their home. He was approaching 20 years of service, making him eligible to retire.

A two-year tour in Japan was winding down, and he was due back in Virginia this month. He and Erin were talking about what he would do next.

""He had the thought of being a fireman,"" she said. ""I said, 'Why would you want to do that? You're going to get out of the Navy, do something easy and no so life-threatening.' He wanted to make a difference.""

The Navy report says Rehm freed a shipmate trapped by a falling locker. That sailor made it through the water to the other side of the listing ship, and reached a ladder leading to an open hatch above.

At the ladder, two sailors helped him to safety. When the water reached neck-level, those two sailors then climbed the ladder themselves.

From the next level up, they stuck their arms into the murky water they had just escaped and grabbed a submerged sailor. And then another.

The Navy report described that last survivor as red-faced and choking on the salty water.

Sealing the hatch

By now, the water was surging upward through the hatch — presenting a terrible dilemma.

""The Fitzgerald is in trouble. She's in deep trouble,"" said Hendrix, the retired captain. ""If you don't seal that room, you risk losing the entire ship.""

Yet more sailors were in the water below. Sealing the hatch would mean sealing their fate.

""You have to place the needs of the entire crew ahead of the needs of the individual sailors, who may well be your friends,"" Hendrix said. ""They may have been somebody who had the bunk next to you, and yet your responsibility at that moment is to seal that hatch.""

By now, the next level up was flooding. The sailors climbed to the main deck and sealed the hatch there.

""It's an awful burden, as you consider that yours was the action that essentially made the final decision in those other sailors' lives,"" Hendrix said. ""Yet those sailors were heroic, in the sense that they ended up saving the entire ship and crew.""

Twenty-eight sailors escaped the living quarters. Seven did not. One was Gary Rehm.

It's not clear what happened in his final moments. But Hendrix has a strong inkling.

""What we do know is that he stopped to save at least one sailor,"" he said. ""There's a presumption that he is continuing with his task, to look elsewhere to find any other sailors that might be trapped.""

After the accident, Navy divers descended into the living quarters to recover the seven bodies.

The last one they found, in a bathroom clogged with wreckage, was Rehm.

A second deadly collision

Just nine weeks after the Fitzgerald's accident, the USS John S. McCain also suffered a large gash in a nighttime collision with a huge commercial ship in a congested Asian shipping lane. Ten sailors died in the flooded quarters below deck.

Analysts have offered several theories about why these accidents are happening: Years of heavy demands. Not enough training. Poor fundamental seamanship.

The Navy's top admiral, John Richardson, has ordered a comprehensive review of the way the Navy operates. Meanwhile, more than 36,000 people have signed a petition asking the Navy to name a ship in memory of Gary Rehm.

Rehm's parents, Gary Rehm Sr. and Anita Rehm, said their son wanted to join the Navy before he finished high school, and they had always feared for his safety.

""His dad didn't want him to join. He wanted me to talk him out of it,"" Anita Rehm said.

""It's always dangerous in the military. You take your chances,"" Gary Rehm Sr. added.

""He always said, 'Mom, you worry too much. What's gonna happen? I'm on a big ship,'"" Anita Rehm said. ""And we got to find out what happens on a big ship.""

"Updated at 5:57 p.m. ET

In his first on-camera remarks amid burgeoning scandals engulfing his White House, President Trump denied he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to scuttle an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

""No. No. Next question,"" Trump responded curtly to a reporter during a news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on Thursday afternoon.

The press conference was also one of Trump's last opportunities to speak on the record to the American media before his first trip overseas as president later this week.

Comey — whom Trump fired May 9 — wrote a memo memorializing a discussion with the president about Flynn and the FBI's investigation, two sources close to the former FBI director who had seen the memo confirmed to NPR.

And on Tuesday, with that latest report fanning the flames on the growing fallout from Trump's decision to terminate Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced he was appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee the Department of Justice investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Trump blasted that decision, echoing his Thursday morning tweets and comments he made over lunch with network news anchors that the Russia investigation is a ""witch hunt"" that ""divides the country.""

""There is no collusion between, certainly myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians. Zero,"" Trump said during the press conference.

""Believe me, there's no collusion,"" the president continued. ""Russia is fine, but whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America.""

""Everybody, even my enemies, have said there was no collusion,"" Trump added, even though some Democrats have voiced concerns about possible collusion and suggested a thorough investigation was necessary.

Trump also changed his story once again about the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing, returning again to the White House's original rationale that he based his decision on Rosenstein's recommendation. That was the White House's position initially after the deputy attorney general argued in a memo that Comey had erred in handling the FBI's investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's private email server, even though Trump had praised Comey on the campaign trail last year.

Trump later said in an interview with NBC News he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., however, told reporters, after Rosenstein briefed the full Senate Thursday afternoon, that the deputy attorney general said he knew Comey would be dismissed by Trump before writing the memo that the White House released when it announced the firing.

Trump also said he would announce his pick to succeed Comey soon and told reporters in the Oval Office with Santos just before their joint news conference that 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman was among the finalists.

"Updated on July 25 at 9:21 p.m. ET

The multiple investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race will open a new chapter Wednesday when the Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing about foreign agents operating in the U.S. lobbying on behalf of foreign governments — and what some consider the lax enforcement of the federal law that governs their activities.

With the hearing, the Senate Judiciary Committee seems to be staking its claim as a fourth major Russia investigation — after the investigations by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Department of Justice special counsel investigation led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Here's a primer to help you sort out which investigation is doing what.

What is it focusing on?

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting a broad inquiry looking at what, exactly, Russia did to influence the 2016 elections and how that fits into broader ""cyberactivity and active measures"" the country has used to target the United States. Part of that includes examining whether there is any evidence that members of President Trump's campaign collaborated with Russian operatives.

""The Committee will follow the intelligence wherever it leads,"" Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement announcing the probe in January.

""We will be conducting the bulk of the Committee's business behind closed doors because we take seriously our obligation to protect sources and methods.""

Key players

The panel is being led by Burr. He advised the Trump campaign last year but has vowed to take the investigation seriously. ""It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties that I might have,"" he told reporters earlier this year.

Burr has separated himself from the Trump administration more than other key Republicans involved in Russia investigations. He voiced concerns about former FBI Director James Comey's firing in May and has said he has seen no evidence backing one of Trump's more outlandish claims — that President Barack Obama ordered a ""wiretap"" of Trump Tower during the presidential campaign.

Warner is the top Democrat on the committee. While the House Intelligence Committee has been characterized by partisan infighting, Warner has worked hard to present a united front with Burr. The two-term senator and former Virginia governor has repeatedly said the investigation is the ""most important thing I've ever done"" in public service.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has several members who are often speculated about as future presidential candidates: Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Democrat Kamala Harris of California.

Most memorable public moment

Nearly 20 million TV viewers tuned in when Comey testified in front of the Intelligence Committee on June 8.

""Those were lies, plain and simple,"" Comey said of the White House's justifications for firing him, adding that Trump ""chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI"" by claiming the bureau was in disarray under Comey's leadership.

Comey went on to say that he believed he had been fired because of the way he handled an ongoing investigation into whether anyone on Trump's campaign coordinated with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.

What the investigation could lead to

Burr and Warner have said their goal is to produce a detailed, bipartisan report summing up the actions Russian operatives took in 2016 to engage in election interference and how similar attacks can be prevented in future elections.

The committee can't recommend criminal charges, as the special counsel investigation is empowered to do.

What is it focusing on?

Like its Senate counterpart, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence wants to write a report answering four questions:

Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans on the committee have publicly focused much of their attention on leaks and whether the Obama administration ""unmasked"" intelligence about Trump associates for political purposes.

Key players

California Republican Nunes remains chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, though in April, he temporarily stepped down as head of its Russia investigation. Nunes' move came in response to an Ethics Committee inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified information over the course of the investigation.

The ethics probe was launched after Nunes made a high-profile trip to the White House to discuss information that he claimed raised questions about whether the Obama administration had improperly ""unmasked"" — or asked for the identity of — Trump associates surveilled during routine foreign intelligence operations. He spoke to reporters about this information before telling his colleagues on the committee about it. ""The committee has been put into suspended animation,"" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., told MSNBC afterward.

Nunes later admitted that his information had initially come from the Trump administration. That raised questions about whether Nunes was providing political cover for the president he was investigating.

While Nunes stepped down from the Russia investigation, he has continued to issue and sign investigation-related subpoenas.

Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is leading this Russia investigation in Nunes' place.

California Rep. Adam Schiff is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most commonly seen public faces of the Russia inquiries.

As the committee's investigation became more partisan, Schiff was forthright not just with the available evidence of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — but also with what it would mean if such a thing were proven true.

""Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don't know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out,"" Schiff said at a March hearing featuring Comey and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers.

Conaway and Schiff tried to repair public confidence in the bipartisan integrity of their investigation by holding a joint press statement on June 6.

Most memorable public moment

Nunes' White House trips created weeks of headlines. But the committee's public hearings have led to several key moments, as well.

The most notable: Comey's first public disclosure of an active FBI probe into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian efforts to influence the election.

What it could lead to

The House Intelligence Committee's end goal is a report laying out its findings. Like the Senate committee, the House investigation won't lead to criminal charges.

The key question is whether the House Intelligence Committee will issue one bipartisan report or two separate findings from its Republican and Democratic camps.

What is it focusing on?

On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Mueller to take charge of the FBI investigation into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian operatives.

This is the leading Russia investigation but also the most secretive. While the House and Senate committees play out in high-profile public hearings, Mueller's investigation will take place behind closed doors. Congressional investigations also tend to defer to law enforcement when it comes to access to witnesses and evidence.

Mueller is charged with investigating ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.""

That second clause has been interpreted to include the question of whether Trump or other White House officials improperly acted to impede the FBI investigation and likely includes the circumstances of the dismissals of both former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Comey.

Key players

Mueller led the FBI for 12 years and began his tenure just a week before the Sept. 11 terror attacks. He's widely respected in Washington.

Other key members of Mueller's investigative team include former FBI chief of staff Aaron Zebley; onetime Watergate prosecutor James Quarles; Andrew Weissmann, who led the Department of Justice's Fraud Division and helped investigate Enron; and Jeannie Rhee, who worked in the Justice Department, as well as Mueller's law firm WilmerHale.

And according to the National Law Journal, Mueller also brought on Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who's one of the most respected lawyers within the Department of Justice.

Most memorable public moment

Over the course of his career, Mueller developed a reputation as someone who does not leak to the news media. So we don't know too much about how the investigation is going.

But as Mueller has added more high-powered lawyers to his team — and outlets like The Washington Post have reported that Mueller may be examining whether Trump obstructed justice — the president has begun openly criticizing Mueller's investigation.

In a June 16 tweet, Trump seems to be criticizing Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller but isn't playing an active role in his investigation.

Despite Trump's tweet to the contrary, his personal lawyers have repeatedly denied the fact the president himself is under investigation.

What it could lead to

 Special counsel investigations into White Houses are notoriously unpredictable. Ken Starr's probe into Bill and Hillary Clinton's alleged real estate improprieties led to a report about Bill Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky and the president's eventual impeachment.

The investigation into whether the Bush White House improperly leaked the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame ultimately led to a top White House aide, Scooter Libby, being convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury.

The key detail here is that Mueller has the power to press criminal charges based on what his investigation uncovers. And his investigation is likely to have broader scope and intensity than the congressional committees, so its findings could have political ramifications as well.

While those are the three most high-profile Russia investigations, there are various other inquiries in different parts of the federal government. Those include:

"The International Olympic Committee says it is banning 11 of Russian athletes for life as part of its investigation into doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Ruling on the last 11 of the 46 cases it has been investigating, the IOC said all were now disqualified from the Sochi Games. The IOC has now banned 43 Russian athletes and stripped 13 medals from the country, according to NBC Sports. Three of the 46 were cleared.

The 11 athletes sanctioned Friday compete in five sports:

The sanctions mean that Russia has lost two more medals from its Sochi count. Ivanova and Demchenko had captured a silver in the mixed relay event, and Demchenko had won an individual silver medal.

Two of the cross-country skiers, Kryukov and Bessmertnykh, had already lost medals when their teammates were disqualified, The Associated Press reports.

Russia is banned from having an official presence at the upcoming 2018 Pyeongchang Games, as punishment for its widespread doping at the Sochi Games.

Some 200 athletes from Russia may still compete at the Olympics under a neutral flag. They are barred from wearing uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag, and they'll sport generic red-and-white logos that say ""Olympic Athlete from Russia.""

"Thousands of people are trying to get off of Ambae island in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where a volcano's increasing activity has created fears of a strong eruption. Some 11,000 people live on the island.

As of Thursday, some 8,000 people had crowded into evacuation centers on Ambae, emergency officials said. Authorities then expanded the effort to a complete evacuation, saying residents and families would be taken to three nearby islands.

The mass exodus is being carried out primarily via boats; it might not be complete until next Friday, Oct. 6, officials say.

""Volcanoes can't be compared to tropical cyclones,"" Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai was quoted as saying by the Vanuatu Independent. ""It's possible dangers are not known hence we must always be on the safe side.""

""Our problem is to always take precaution and ensure people's lives are in good hands,"" Salwai said, before adding, ""Continue to pray for our loved ones, families and friends on Ambae.""

Vanuatu has asked its neighbors, Australia and New Zealand, for help in coping with the crisis — including aid, food and supplies for those now displaced. The country lies roughly a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii.

Looming nearly 5,000 feet above sea level, the Manaro Voui volcano is currently described as being in ""an ongoing moderate eruption state"" by the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department. Its alert level is at 4 — one short of a ""very large eruption.""

The volcano, also known as Lombenben and Aoba, is almost directly in the center of Ambae, an oblong island whose population is grouped primarily along the coast, particularly in the northeast. Officials say they're particularly worried about the area east of the volcano, where a large lahar — a destructive mudflow — would likely hit. On the west side, they say, heavy ash could fall from the sky.

Other hazards include acid rain, flying rock and gas. Vanuatu's disaster agency also warns that in addition to the threat of a very large eruption at the volcano's caldera — it's home to three lakes — new vents and cones could also open.

""I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,"" President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said in a statement prior to his closed-door meeting Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Speaking to reporters at the White House after the appearance, he said that documents and records that he provided the committee ""show that all of my actions are proper, and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign.""

Kushner took no questions from journalists, but said he looks forward to answering questions from the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Both committees are conducting investigations into possible links between Trump associates and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign.

In the 11-page statement, Kushner states that he had ""hardly any"" contact with Russia or Russia representatives during the campaign.

He says he was present for a highly scrutinized meeting with a Russian attorney last summer. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., recently released emails indicating that an intermediary had promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Kremlin-connected lawyer.

""When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children,"" Kushner states. ""I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting.""

Kushner adds: ""I have no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sectors.""

He says that he has ""tried to be fully transparent"" in the form required to obtain a security clearance, ""above and beyond what is required.""

As NPR has reported, Kushner has faced scrutiny for not initially including meetings with Russian officials on that form, called the SF-86. Kushner says the form was ""prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication"" with his assistant. He adds that it was not just information pertaining to Russians missing — ""all foreign contacts were omitted.""

NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports that the statement contains a number of ""pre-buttals to a lot of questions people have,"" such as:

""One, whether or not he had an ongoing or extensive relationship at all with Russian officials, and whether or not he was using the campaign in a way to be able to try to pay back some of the $1.3 billion that he and his family still owe for this building on Fifth Avenue that they've built. And there was a meeting with a Russian bank official in which a lot of the people on the Hill have some questions about.""

Last December, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the CEO of the Russian Vnesheconombank, which was subject to U.S. sanctions. Kushner says Russia's ambassador was ""insistent"" about the meeting, telling his assistant that Gorkov was ""someone with a direct line to the Russian president who could give insight into how [Vladimir] Putin was viewing the new administration and the best ways to work together.""

Kushner describes a ""twenty to twenty-five"" minute meeting with Gorkov, in which the banker gave him two gifts and expressed ""hopes for a better relationship in the future"" between the U.S. and Russia. He says they did not discuss specific policies and have not been in contact since.

"All we want are the facts, ma'am.

During his congressional testimony Thursday, James Comey played his best Sgt. Joe Friday, the protagonist of the 1950s Dragnet TV series known for that signature line.

Asked whether he thought President Trump obstructed justice, Comey, the fired FBI director, declined to give his opinion.

""I don't know,"" Comey said. ""That — that's Bob Mueller's job to sort that out.""

Mueller is the former FBI director who is now the special counsel in charge of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and Trump campaign associates' connections to Russia.

Comey admitted to authorizing the leak of a memo he wrote about a meeting with the president that gave him pause. And he did it for an eyebrow-raising reason — ""because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,"" Comey said.

For as much as Comey wanted to be the indefatigable facts man full of public rectitude, he clearly thought Trump had done something wrong — and he revealed that he had an agenda.

While Comey may not have expressed an overt opinion about whether Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice, the careful former prosecutor certainly laid out a set of facts that any prosecutor could use to try to prove just that.

Trump has contested Comey's testimony, saying in a news conference Friday that Comey said things that ""just weren't true."" Specifically, Trump claimed he never asked for a pledge of loyalty from Comey or asked Comey to let go of investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Someone's lying.

Comey was under oath on Thursday — and he accused Trump of lying. Pressed Friday, the president said he would be ""glad"" to testify under oath if that's what Mueller wants, ""100 percent."" Asked whether there are tapes of the conversations with Comey, which the president teased on Twitter after Comey's firing, Trump seemed to have his bluff called.

""I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the near future,"" he said. ""You're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don't worry.""

Comey, during testimony Thursday, said he welcomed their release. ""Lordy, I hope there are tapes.""

Until Trump does go under oath, any of his accusations against Comey should be met with skepticism. He and his White House have damaged their credibility with a history of falsehoods and misstatements on things small and large.

There are a lot of people with assured opinions about whether Trump obstructed justice in this case, if the facts Comey lays out are true.

On the one hand: "" 'No question' Trump involved in obstruction of justice: Former Watergate prosecutor.""

But on the other: ""What Comey described wasn't obstruction of justice. Here's why.""

First, what exactly constitutes obstruction of justice? Here's how Cornell Law School explains it:

""Obstruction of justice is defined in the omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which provides that 'whoever ... corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be (guilty of an offense).' Persons are charged under this statute based on allegations that a defendant intended to intefere with an official proceeding, by doing things such as destroying evidence, or intefering with the duties of jurors or court officers.

""A person obstructs justice when they have a specific intent to obstruct or interfere with a judicial proceeding. For a person to be convicted of obstructing justice, they must not only have the specific intent to obstruct the proceeding, but the person must know (1) that a proceeding was actually pending at the time; and (2) there must be a nexus between the defendant's endeavor to obstruct justice and the proceeding, and the defendant must have knowledge of this nexus.

""§ 1503 applies only to federal judicial proceedings. Under § 1505, however, a defendant can be convicted of obstruction of justice by obstructing a pending proceeding before Congress or a federal agency. A pending proceeding could include an informal investigation by an executive agency.""

Comey issued a detailed opening statement the day before the hearing. In it, he said that during a Feb. 14 meeting in the Oval Office, the president dismissed a large group that was in the office, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.

Trump told them he wanted to speak to Comey alone.

At one point, the president even waved off White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who had poked his head in to check on the meeting.

""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" Trump told Comey, according to Comey's notes. ""He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.""

Trump denies he said this, both through his lawyer and in the news conference Friday.

But as the investigation picked up steam, and Flynn was increasingly a key player, the president fired Comey. The White House initially cited a memo from the deputy attorney general about Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during the campaign.

Trump later undermined that rationale in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt. Comey believed the reasoning was dubious, and, for him, the NBC interview confirmed that he was fired because of the Russia investigation.

There are a few key points in all of this to dig into to determine whether what Trump did, if Comey's account holds up, is obstruction (which can be difficult to prove).

1. What did Trump mean by ""hope""?

2. Does Trump dismissing senior officials during his one-on-one meeting with Comey constitute intent? and

3. Is it reasonable to assume that Trump was hoping to quash the FBI's investigation with Comey's firing?

Let's take these point by point.

1. Hope and change the investigation?

The line about ""hope"" was at the center of questioning by some Republicans. Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, also a former prosecutor, was making Trump's case.

""Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or, for that matter, any other criminal offense, where this — they said, or thought, they hoped for an outcome?"" Risch asked.  Comey said he wasn't sure, but added insistently, ""I took it as a direction. I mean, this is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying, 'I hope' this. I took it as this is what he wants me to do.""

In response to questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Comey defended not telling agents working on the case about the interaction with the president:

""We don't want the agents and analysts working on this to know the president of the United States has — has asked — and when it comes from the president, I took it as a direction — to get rid of this investigation, because we're not going to follow that — that request.""

2. Did Trump clearing the room equal intent?

Comey seemed intent on making sure there was no ambiguity that he thought it was a big deal that Trump asked others to leave. Here is how he laid it out in his opening statement:

""The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn.' ""

Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford attempted a Trump defense, noting that the president has already tweeted publicly that he ""is not real fond of this investigation.""

He is telling 6 billion people he doesn't like it, Lankford noted, before asking this: ""Do you think there's a difference in that?""

Without missing a beat, Comey answered — absolutely, there was a difference.

""I think there's a big difference in kicking superior officers out of the Oval Office, looking the FBI director in the eye and saying, 'Hope you'll let this go,' "" Comey shot back. ""I think if our — if the agents, as good as they are, heard the president of the United States did that ... there's a real risk of a chilling effect on their work. That's why we kept it so tight.""

Comey stressed repeatedly the significance of Trump dismissing the attorney general and Kushner. Early on in the hearing, for example, Comey set this dramatic scene — veering from just the facts with a subjective interpretation of Sessions' and Kushner's behavior:

""My impression was something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word that is spoken. And, again, I could be wrong, but I'm 56 years old. I've been — seen a few things. My sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn't be leaving, which is why he was lingering. And I don't know Mr. Kushner well, but I think he picked up on the same thing. And so I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to.""

If that wasn't enough, later Comey implored the committee:

""You got to take it all together. And I've tried to be open and fair and transparent and accurate. A really significant fact to me is, so why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office?""

And in case you missed that he thought it was significant, with his next breath, he seemed to pull the curtain back and try to show the committee the road map for how to build a case, even noting how he would gather evidence as an investigator:

""Why would you kick the attorney general, the president, the chief of staff out, to talk to me, if it was about something else? And so that — that, to me, is — as an investigator, is a very significant fact.""

Comey tried to get across that he thought what Trump did was so inappropriate, so much of a threat, that he said he did not want to be left alone with the president again:

""I specifically, as I said in my testimony, asked the — told the attorney general, it can't happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged the interaction was inappropriate but chalked it up to Trump being a harmless political naïf.

""Of course there needs to be a degree of independence between [the Justice Department], FBI and the White House, and a line of communications established,"" Ryan said Thursday across the Capitol from where Comey was testifying. ""The president's new at this. He's new to government. So, he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. He's just new to this.""

But Comey's testimony undercuts this line of reasoning. The picture Comey paints is not of political naïveté on the president's part but of one who intended to pressure him, who knew exactly what he was doing and who knew he might be about to say something that could be construed as inappropriate even by top White House allies.

3. Out of the fire

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov feigned surprise and disbelief when he heard from reporters at the State Department that Comey had been fired the day before.

""Was he fired?"" he asked with a smirk. ""You're kidding,"" he added, before walking away.

That was the same day, across town at the White House, that Trump bragged to the Russians that he had fired Comey and that pressure had been taken off the investigation.

""I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,"" Trump told Lavrov and other Russian officials gathered in the Oval Office exactly one month ago, according to The New York Times. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. Now, that's taken off.""

In his testimony, Comey made note of that, mentioning that Trump brought up his firing as evidence that the investigation would lighten up now.

""It confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation and learned, again, from the media that he was telling, privately, other parties that my firing had relieved great pressure on the Russia investigation,"" Comey said.

""[T]elling, privately, other parties"" is a clear allusion to the Trump meeting with Russian officials in the Oval.

But that was not the only mention:

""I know I was fired. Again, I take the president's words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was, in some way, putting pressure on him, in some way, irritating him. And he decided to fire me because of that.""

And:

""It's my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired, in some way, to change — or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted.""

Comey repeatedly implied that he believed Trump was holding his desire to stay in the job over his head, thinking he could extract loyalty from him, a quid pro quo:

""My common sense told me that what was going on is either he had concluded, or someone had told him, that you didn't — you've already asked Comey to stay, and you didn't get anything for it, and that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship — in fact, he asked specifically — of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay.""

Comey expanded on what he found to be the significance of being fired because of the Russia investigation (just in case the senators and viewing audience couldn't discern it for themselves):

""That is a — that is a very big deal, and not just because it involves me. The nature of the FBI and the nature of its work requires that it not be the subject of political consideration. And on top of that, you have — the Russia investigation itself is vital, because of the threat. And I know I should've said this earlier, but it's obvious — if any Americans were part of helping the Russians do that to us, that is a very big deal. And I'm confident that, if that is the case, Director Mueller will find that evidence.""

Once again, it was another Mueller reference from Comey. That is yet another bread crumb Comey is laying out for investigators to follow and connect to intent — that Trump was trying to quash the investigation. ""Again, I take the president's words. ...""

The trail is out there. And Mueller is an uberdetailed, hyperthorough investigator. He will likely pick each one up with tongs and latex gloves, put them in a Ziploc bag and have them sent back to the lab for examination, leaving no bread crumb unanalyzed.

After all, as Comey said in the hearing, ""In any complex investigation, when you start turning over rocks, sometimes you find things that are unrelated to the primary investigation, that are criminal in nature.""

The president has hired a bulldog lawyer, one who has protected Trump's interests — and his brand — over the years. He's a loyalist and a corporate lawyer — not a criminal defense attorney.

If Trump and his team aren't careful — and they don't start treating this as a genuine legal problem instead of just a political one — all the president's men could find themselves in a heap of trouble.

And that doesn't mean his political problem is going away. Even if Mueller doesn't believe the standard for criminal prosecution of obstruction is met, his findings, if he puts credence in Comey's testimony, could be damning and lay the foundation for articles of impeachment when or if Democrats wrest back control of Congress at some point in the Trump presidency.

"What does Michael Flynn, President Trump's erstwhile national security adviser, think about Russia?

His statements and actions are so contradictory, they could induce whiplash.

In his book, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies, published last July, here is what Flynn thought about working with Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""There's no reason to believe Putin would welcome cooperation with us. Quite the contrary, in fact.""

Seems clear enough: Russia is an adversary. Be wary of Putin. A standard position in the national security community.

Yet Flynn was also busy making contacts with Russia. In December 2015, Flynn sat next to Putin in Moscow at a celebration for RT, the state-run TV network.

Documents show that Flynn was paid $33,000 for a speech he delivered at the event. As a retired Army lieutenant general, he was required to get permission from the military to receive payments from a foreign government, and according to media reports, it's not clear whether he requested it.

The Pentagon's inspector general is looking into the matter, which is just one aspect of Flynn's legal troubles.

In early 2016, Flynn began advising Trump. They seemed to be on the same page, both willing to explore the possibility of better relations with Moscow.

But Flynn the Trump supporter seemed at odds with Flynn the strategist. In his book, he was sharply critical of recent Russian military moves, including plans for new military bases near the country's western border and an upgrade for their nuclear forces.

""These are not the actions of a country seeking detente with the West,"" he said. ""They are, rather, indications that Putin fully intends to do the same thing, as, and in tandem with, the Iranians. Pursue the war against us.""  In Flynn's view, Russia, Iran and several other countries are part of a ""global alliance"" that seeks to undermine the U.S.

In an interview with NPR last August, he said:

""When we think about countries like Russia, countries like Cuba, countries like Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, I mean, these are — in many cases, these are criminal enterprises that — that have dictatorships and certainly tyrants.""

However, he also said the U.S. and Russia could work together at times, citing the fight against the Islamic State in Syria.

He told the German magazine Der Spiegel: ""We have to work constructively with Russia. ... You can't say Russia is bad, they have to go home. It's not going to happen. Get real.""

Compare that with what he wrote in his book about Russia's role in Syria, where it supports President Bashar Assad: ""They are certainly not fighting terrorists in the Middle East. Theirs is a battle to rescue an embattled ally in Damascus.""

So what's behind these contradictions? Are they just confusing but perfectly legal?

Flynn hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, but investigators are looking closely at Flynn's contacts with Russian officials. Here's a quick recap:

Reuters reported Thursday that Flynn was in touch with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, during the presidential campaign. These contacts picked up after the election, when Flynn was named national security adviser.

The two met in New York at Trump Tower in early December. They reportedly spoke by phone on Dec. 19. They texted on Christmas and spoke again on Dec. 28 and 29.

Flynn told Vice President Pence they didn't discuss sanctions against Russia — but it turned out they did.

Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, warned the White House.

""I think this was a serious compromise situation that the Russians had real leverage. He [Flynn] also had lied to the vice president of the United States,"" she said in an interview this week with CNN.

Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13, and Flynn has been keeping a low profile since then. But he is still in the headlines.

As reported by NPR and others, then-FBI Director James Comey wrote notes about a meeting with Trump on Feb. 14, saying the president asked if he could ""let go"" of the Flynn investigation.

The White House disputes this. The investigation continues.

"Robert Mueller, who has been appointed to handle the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, took the reins as FBI director a week before the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. That day would influence his entire 12-year run leading the agency.

Mueller oversaw arguably the most significant changes the century-old FBI had gone through, and he received praise from lawmakers from both parties on Wednesday for his commitment to justice.

""I had been a prosecutor before, so I anticipated spending time on public corruption cases and narcotics cases and bank robberies and the like,"" he told NPR in 2013. ""And Sept. 11 changed all of that.""

Mueller overhauled the agency to prioritize, first, the threat of terrorism from groups like al-Qaida and the Taliban and then, later, the threat from individuals not affiliated with any particular group, like the Tsarnaev brothers, who were behind the Boston Marathon bombing.

He moved thousands of agents from criminal investigations into counterterrorism and national security. He detailed the changes in 2003, at an American Civil Liberties Union conference:

""The Sept. 11 attacks against New York and Washington changed the course of history.

""They changed the meaning of national security for the United States and dramatically shifted FBI priorities so that the prevention of terrorist attacks became the FBI's top priority and overriding focus.

""While we remain committed to our other important national security and law enforcement responsibilities, the prevention of terrorism takes precedence in our thinking and planning; in our hiring and staffing; in our training and technologies; and, most importantly, in our investigations.""

As his 12-year run as director was coming to a close, Mueller also began prioritizing cyberthreats.

John Pistole, Mueller's former deputy director at the FBI, told NPR near the end of Mueller's term that it was hard to overstate the director's footprint on the agency.

""He directed and implemented what is arguably the most significant change in the FBI's [entire] history,"" Pistole said.

Still, despite enjoying broad support from both sides of the aisle, his tenure with the FBI wasn't without its issues. In the mid-2000s, there were calls to break up the FBI, and in 2007, the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General blasted the agency for its data-gathering practices.

In a glowing editorial in 2011, The Washington Post editorial board praised Mueller's response to those critiques, saying he moved ""assertively to fix the problems.""

""It was not the first time Mr. Mueller showed character under fire,"" the board wrote. ""In 2002, after learning of other agencies' possible interrogation abuses at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Mr. Mueller ordered FBI agents to stay clear of such techniques. And in 2004, he joined other high-level law enforcement officials in threatening to resign if the administration failed to address legal problems with the terrorist surveillance program.""

Among the other officials threatening to resign from the Justice Department at that time was James Comey. Comey did in fact resign as deputy attorney general in 2005, and eight years later, he was confirmed as director of the FBI. His firing from that position on May 9 led legislators, mostly Democrats, to ratchet up calls for the special investigator role Mueller is taking on. Comey's dismissal cut short the traditional 10-year term.

Mueller ultimately served 12 years, after President Barack Obama asked Congress to extend his term for two extra years in 2011. The president argued that the country's national security agencies needed consistency, as the Pentagon and CIA were also getting new leaders at the time.

In a vote that showed Mueller's broad appeal to Republicans and Democrats, Congress voted unanimously at the time to approve the request.

""The fact that some are playing politics does not mean that he'll cease being law enforcement,"" said former Attorney General John Ashcroft on Wednesday. ""Frankly, the barking dogs or the clamor of politics won't affect what he does.""

Ashcroft, who worked closely with Mueller, added that he used to call Mueller ""Square-Jaw McGraw"" because of his evenhandedness. Within the FBI, Mueller became known for his gruff taciturnity.

Earlier in life, Mueller served as a U.S. Marine officer and was a federal prosecutor in three U.S. attorneys' offices. He graduated from Princeton University in 1966 and received his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1973.

Former Justice Department prosecutor David Margolis once joked that Mueller could have been perfect for a different, lower-profile job.

""A job he was born for, and has spent his whole life preparing for, drill instructor at Parris Island,"" Margolis said at an awards ceremony near the time Mueller left the FBI.

Even the normally stoic Mueller broke into a laugh at that one.

In a previous version of this story, we incorrectly said James Comey was confirmed seven years after resigning as deputy attorney general. He was confirmed eight years later. In addition, we previously said Robert Mueller was an assistant U.S. attorney in three offices. He actually served multiple positions in the three U.S. attorneys' offices.

"For many of the estimated 170,000 children who go online for the first time each day, the virtual universe will offer new possibilities to connect with the world — and access to unbounded knowledge and services.

But the virtual world can also present dangers. And kids who don't yet have the awareness to navigate the Web safely could fall prey to those threats.

Laurence Chandy, UNICEF's director of data, research and policy, says that while a third of all Internet users are kids, consumer protections don't always have children in mind.

""You never saw any mention of child or children at all in your standard regulation for safety on the Internet,"" he says.

This prompted Chandy and his team at UNICEF to publish a report on Dec. 11.

""We initially saw it as a child protection issue, and then also health and education and other areas, too,"" he says.

Goats & Soda spoke with Chandy about how the Internet creates hazards and benefits for children around the world — and the strategies UNICEF believes could help make the Internet work for its youngest denizens.

Here's what he said (edited for length and clarity):

Perhaps we're just optimistic, but the Internet always seemed like the great repository of human knowledge. Hasn't it done a lot of good for children around the world?

The benefits are quite varied. One is access to information, but it also extends to recreation and play and having children's voices heard. You also have the most marginalized children, like disabled children, who find the technology very transformative and unlocking access to community. I know of one Russian boy with cerebral palsy who had an electronic notepad [change] his ability to interact with the world.

We do talk about this technology being a great leveler, a great instrument for equity and enabling access to information at zero cost. But it's also really becoming a divider. It's a huge inequity between those who have access and those who do not. [We're] recognizing that poor people cannot afford to use the Internet. There is a gender gap that discourages girls from using the technology. And — this is unfamiliar for those of us brought up with English as a native tongue — the issue of relevant content. If you are living in a small country with its own language, there won't be much relevant information. We might be on the precipice of translation technology — things that could instantaneously and accurately translate from one language to another. That could be a game changer on its own.

The report discusses a lot of the dangers to children. What are some of these?

There's bullying, which we know. The most striking risk is the sexual abuse of children and how the Internet is being used to enable that industry. [In the report], there's the story of a 12-year-old girl in the Philippines who was coerced by her neighbor to undress online. On the website [where the neighbor posted video], there were men in the West from the U.S. and the U.K. who paid really small amounts of money [to see this]. One of the men who was paying to see these acts flew over to the Philippines and tried to rape her. The authorities managed to rescue this girl.

This is the extreme grotesque story which speaks to the risks. Certain online services for sharing materials and payment systems enable this abuse. It's, frankly, really harrowing, but thankfully that's a small minority of people.

This case also says something about the virtual becoming physical. Whenever we use the Internet or log in to an app, we leave traces of ourselves on the Web. Does this pose a security risk to children as well as adults?

In the developing world, the most likely way you access the Internet is via a smartphone or quasi-smartphone. You have some kind of app. The first screen asks: What's your name, gender, date of birth and some other personal information? How are corporations using that information — and is it safe and do children have the right to be forgotten and have their data erased?

We don't know much at all about how the data are used and shared. There's no effort to convey to a child what the risk is or the terms and conditions. There are some creative companies like Mozilla that are developing conditions that young people can understand, but we haven't had that conversation [in general].

What are some things UNICEF thinks should be done to protect and help children?

We're thinking about universal access, corporate stewardship and personal responsibility. We're trying to work with corporations and regulators and policymakers in an evidence-based way to think of children as users. We're not saying keep them off this exciting technology, because we want the benefits, too. It's a huge part of our lives now, and these are difficult issues with no clear answer.

"Updated at 12:50 p.m. ET

In 1983, an explosive story appeared in an Indian newspaper, The Patriot: the AIDS virus was the result of American biological weapons research.

Two years later a Soviet newspaper picked up the thread: The U.S. Army had developed AIDS as a bioweapon at Fort Detrick, Md. Other publications followed suit and by 1986, an East German biology professor was publishing ""research"" in which he explained that the virus had been tested on service members used as human guinea pigs — who then began spreading it among vulnerable populations.

None of it was true. All of it was fiction created by Russian intelligence officers or their allies.

But the storyline — that the U.S. government created AIDS — has proven one of the most durable examples of ""dezinformatsiya,"" as it was known to its practitioners in the Soviet intelligence world.

Both that story (Kanye West believed it) and those practices endure today in the world's information bloodstream, and former CIA Director John Brennan appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill to talk about ""active measures"" with the House Intelligence Committee.

Members of Congress want to focus on the ones the Russians used last year during the presidential campaign, but the deliberate crafting of falsehoods for political aims is just one of the tools in this kit, and leaders in Washington say the challenge they pose is just as urgent now as it has ever been.

""In essence, these active measures are an ongoing threat — not simply something that happened in the past,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said at a May 11 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

The heads of America's spy agencies agreed.

""The use of cyber and social media has significantly increased the impact and the capabilities that — obviously this has been done for years and years, even decades,"" said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. ""But the ability they have to use the interconnectedness [of the Internet] and all that provides ... they literally upped their game to the point where it's having a significant impact.""

And the interest by Russian intelligence in influencing public opinion in the United States goes beyond the political sphere, members of Congress warned. The U.S. intelligence community concluded Moscow intervened in last year's presidential race to hurt Hillary Clinton and help President Trump, but Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the Russians have — and have had — other targets.

Cotton cited past Russian efforts to undermine U.S. nuclear modernization, missile defense deployments and enforcement of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty — which American defense officials say Russian forces have violated with the deployment of a new missile in Eastern Europe.

""These [are] activities that will go far beyond elections, I think,"" Cotton said.

The cold-hearted king

Forgery, lies and skulduggery are as old as statecraft, wrote Robert Wallace, H. Keith Melton and Henry Robert Schlesinger in their CIA history, Spycraft. The authors cite a fake letter created in 1777 by Ben Franklin that appeared to be from a German king to England's King George III.

In the letter, King Frederick of Hesse — who was paid a bonus each time one of his mercenaries died in fighting the British war against the American colonies — ""suggested"" to King George that they be used more aggressively and denied medical treatment. In short, the German king appeared to want more of his men killed so the British king would pay him more.

That ""letter"" was ""leaked"" and the callous impression it created, along with other enticements by the American side, induced thousands of Hessians to quit the war, wrote Wallace, Melton and Schlesinger.

Such tricks continued down the years, with varying degrees of sophistication. In some examples they go beyond the simple release of information. In 1969, Sudanese goatherds found a cache of ""American"" spy equipment: a magnetic Limpet mine, a .22 caliber gun shaped like a pen and ""State Department"" documents revealing a plot against the government.

The materials appeared after the government in Khartoum broke off relations with the U.S. over its support for Israel and just as leaders there began to lean toward closer ties with the Soviet Union. As Wallace, Melton and Schlesinger describe, they were placed by the KGB to give the Sudanese a nudge — though CIA officer David Crown ultimately defeated that scheme.

Today, ""active measures"" take a range of forms, according to Mark Galeotti, author of a brief called ""Putin's Hydra: Inside Russia's Intelligence Services."" They scale from Internet mischief — manipulating which stories Google or Facebook is likeliest to show users — to hacking and leaks to political assassination.

Cases like the 2006 murder of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned by radioactive tea, are more than the simple use of violence to eliminate troublemakers, Galeotti argues. Targets such as Vladimir Kara-Murza — an opposition figure who has twice been sickened by mysterious poison that he blames on people connected to Russia's ""special services"" — often suffer in public, sending the world a chilling message about the costs of opposing the regime.

That kind of violence might not become commonplace within the United States, but national security leaders warn that they expect Russia to resume meddling in the American political process. The current and former spy bosses who've been speaking to Congress about the mischief in the 2016 race say that Moscow considers it a success.

""The transcendent issue here is the Russian interference in our election process, and what that means to the erosion of the fundamental fabric of our democracy,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.

He called for ""educating"" Americans about the use of disinformation and for a major push at ""counter-messaging"" by Washington. Others are more hawkish: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wants the United States to impose a ""cost"" on Russian leaders so they don't feel they can interfere without penalty.

One problem, as CIA Director Mike Pompeo told a later Senate hearing, is that what technology ultimately does is drive the price the other way.

""The cost,"" he said, ""has been lessened.""

"Updated 11:34 a.m. ET

This week in the Russia investigations: Flynn makes a deal ... What other dominoes could fall? ... Donald Trump Jr. has another date on Capitol Hill.

The missing middle act

Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is telling the Russia tale out of order. First came Act 1, presented a month ago: Russian agents importuned then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign in early 2016. Then, on Friday, Mueller unveiled Act 3: Then-national security adviser Mike Flynn actively coordinated policy with Russia at the end of 2016, as he and the nascent administration prepared to take power.

Now the question is: What happened in Act 2?

There is a lot of material out there already in court documents, congressional testimony and press reports. People in the Trump camp met with or communicated with foreigners and were aware of Russian offers of help and meetings with top officials. The Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence confirmed publicly on Oct. 7, 2016, that Russia had been running a cyber campaign against the U.S. — and the breadth of the Russian effort's clandestine and overt aspects have been revealed since.

But was there ever a formal quid that made Flynn's discussions with Russia's then-ambassador amount to a pro quo? That was the question raised by Flynn's guilty plea on Friday, in which he admitted to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador in late December 2016.

Flynn conferred with the Trump transition team to ask then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak not to retaliate against the U.S. after the Obama administration ejected a number of Russian spies and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for Moscow's attack on the 2016 election. Trump had campaigned on better relations with Russia, and after Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't kick out an equal number of Americans, President-elect Donald Trump hailed him on Twitter.

So, was this the culmination of months of work together behind the scenes? Or did the Russians who met after the election with Flynn and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner only then say something like: ""We helped your guy win. What will you do for us?"" Or did any high-level coordination take place beyond the spasmodic examples documented in the press thus far?

Speaking Saturday morning before departing for New York City, President Trump again denied any coordination between Russia and his campaign. ""What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion. There's been absolutely no collusion, so we're very happy,"" Trump said when asked about Flynn's guilty plea, according to a pool report.

Act 2 is the incomplete piece of the Russia story. And, D.C. is on tenterhooks waiting for it.

It takes a village

Court documents relating to Flynn do make several things clear: First, Flynn was conferring with transition team officials all along about his discussions with foreign officials, including Russia's. So he was not acting on his own as Trump first said — although Trump also said that he approved of Flynn's activities when he learned what they were.

Second, the documents establish there was more on Flynn's to-do list than the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Russia. He was also talking with other foreign powers about an upcoming vote at the United Nations in an attempt to undermine the Obama administration. And a person familiar with the matter told NPR's Carrie Johnson that nobody ""ordered"" that effort — Flynn, Kushner, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus all were working on it at the same time. That might violate a law that prohibits Americans out of power from negotiating on behalf of the United States — although it's one of those strange old laws for which no violator ever has been jailed.

Third, the Flynn court documents confirm that Flynn signed his plea agreement only on Thursday — just one day before his court appearance Friday. The story of the special counsel investigation is very much playing out in real time, before the eyes of the public. So in a sense, Flynn's plea restarts the clock on the imbroglio, or shifts it into a new phase. Now Mueller has the cooperation of a witness who was at Trump's right hand for 2016 and into the administration, one who is presumably willing to tell everything he knows as part of his plea agreement.

The disappearing man

The Flynn news is perilous for other people in the Trump camp — especially Kushner, who remains in the White House. If Kushner was, on his own authority, directing Flynn to make accommodations with the Russians as part of a quid pro quo, that could be bad. If Kushner was the messenger from Trump, that could make things even worse for the administration.

Before the Flynn news, one of the big Russia stories during the week was the confirmation that Kushner had talked with Mueller's investigators. But perhaps because of that — or because the White House knew what to expect from Mueller on Friday — Kushner's stock inside the White House already had reportedly been ticking down.

The New York Times and The Washington Post fired off twin salvos recently that described a diminished role for Kushner from his initial mandate of doing ... everything. In fact, the Times raised the prospect that he and his wife, Trump daughter Ivanka, might quit Washington, D.C., altogether within the next few months and return full time to New York City (a prospect Kushner himself disavowed in speaking to the Post).

That was before Flynn turned state's evidence, however, and now that he is cooperating, investigators could have many more questions for Kushner and others.

Guess who's back

Amid all the late-breaking upheaval, Donald Trump Jr. has a date in Washington next week for a round of questions with the House Intelligence Committee. It'll be at least his second visit to the Capitol to meet with members of Congress; he last ventured down from New York to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.

Trump Jr. has among the most connections — based on what we know now — to foreigners involved in Russia's 2016 attack on the election. He accepted what was described as an offer of help from the Russian government and convened a meeting with a Russian delegation at Trump Tower in June 2016. He acknowledged communicating with WikiLeaks, which released material stolen in Russian cyberattacks to great effect during the 2016 presidential race.

What does Trump Jr. say about it all? This: ""Keep coming at me guys!!!""

The president's oldest son is outspoken on social media and has been making campaign-style personal appearances, including one for which he was paid $100,000, as Drew Harwell reported for the The Washington Post. If Trump Jr. is worried about legal trouble for the actions he has acknowledged, or other things still unknown, he isn't showing it. He insists he has done nothing wrong.

Attorneys say he intends to keep cooperating with congressional investigators and others, but if the past is any guide, don't expect a big dog-and-pony show. The last time Trump Jr. was in the Capitol he slipped in and out without a fuss.

The 'chaos' theory cuts both ways

People in the Trump orbit have sounded a very similar note when explaining their experience on the campaign trail last year: It was frenzied and frantic, and they could barely hang on. In some cases, it was their first time on a presidential campaign. So if they might have taken part in meetings or had communications that critics call suspicious in retrospect, it was all a blur.

Meaning what? As one legal expert told NPR, the question about how effective the chaos defense might be in court depends heavily on which charges prosecutors might eventually bring.

Feds only warned a handful of cyber-victims

The FBI didn't notify ""scores"" of U.S. officials and others that they were being targeted by Russian government cyberattacks, Raphael Satter, Jeff Donn and Desmond Butler report for The Associated Press. Russian spy agencies launched a broad cyberattack against about 1,000 targets starting in 2015.

Meaning what? The story underscored what has been called the slipshod response to Russia's campaign by the Obama administration generally and the specific, individual charges of nincompoopery against the FBI. There could be more embarrassments depending on what Republican-led House committees uncover as they continue or begin investigations into the FBI's conduct last year.

"Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET

Former FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he believed he was fired by President Trump over the growing Russia investigation and that other arguments by the White House were ""lies, plain and simple.""

In bombshell testimony Thursday, Comey, who was abruptly let go a month ago, said he began documenting his numerous, and often uncomfortable, conversations with Trump — in which the president asked for his ""loyalty"" and for him to scuttle the FBI's investigation into former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn — because he ""was honestly concerned (Trump) might lie"" about their meetings.

""I knew there might come a day when I might need a record of what happened not just to defend myself"" but also the FBI, Comey added.

""My impression is something big is about to happen. I need to remember every word that is spoken,"" he said of the memos he wrote immediately after his encounters with the president.

White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later pushed back on Comey's assertions, telling reporters that ""I can definitely say the president is not a liar and I think it's frankly insulting"" that the question was asked.

""Shifting explanations"" for Comey's firing 

The former FBI director also zeroed in on Trump's evolving explanations for why he had been let go, saying he was ""confused"" and ""increasingly concerned"" about the ""shifting explanations"" Trump gave. The president initially pointed to Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as the impetus but later conceded the firing was because of his handling of the Russia investigation and claimed Comey was overseeing a demoralized FBI in disarray.

""So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation and learned again from the media that he was telling, privately, other parties that my firing had relieved 'great pressure' on the Russia investigation,"" Comey said, referring to reporting on Trump's conversation with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after the dismissal.

""The administration then chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI,"" Comey said, by claiming the agency was ""poorly led.""

""Those were lies, plain and simple,"" Comey bluntly told the committee.

Awkward ""loyalty"" dinners and Oval Office pressure

Comey's highly anticipated testimony followed the release by the committee of his written statement on Wednesday, which ticked off in rich detail the extent to which Trump pressed him about the Russia investigation. Comey wrote that Trump asked him for a ""loyalty"" pledge during a one-on-one dinner and later told Comey in a solo Oval Office meeting that he ""hope[d] you can let ... go"" of the Flynn investigation.

The president has denied both those accusations. But Comey's testimony only confirmed the many bombshell reports over the past few weeks about the private conversations he had with Trump, many of them unprecedented and possibly inappropriate.

Comey told the committee that he did see Trump's request for loyalty from him — an independent arbiter atop the FBI — as a sort of quid pro quo.

""My common sense told me what's going on here is he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job,"" Comey said.

He also said that in a now-infamous photo just days after Trump's inauguration in which the president shook his hand and embraced him, Trump whispered in his ear, ""I really look forward to working with you.""

On Trump's Feb. 14 private conversation with Comey in the Oval Office — the day after Flynn was asked to resign for misleading Vice President Pence over his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition — Comey said that he believed the president was indeed directing him to scuttle the investigation into Flynn.

""I took it as a direction,"" which he didn't follow, Comey said. ""I took it as, this is what he wants me to do."" Comey also added that, at that time, Flynn was indeed in ""legal jeopardy"" over his ties and contacts with the Russians.

He noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to linger in on that meeting, and he said that it was his ""sense"" that Sessions ""knew he shouldn't be leaving."" According to Comey's written testimony, he later told Sessions he didn't want to be left alone with Trump again. Comey said during questioning that he was ""stunned"" by that conversation and the president asking everyone else to leave and later said it was a ""significant fact"" to him as a prosecutor that Trump wanted to speak with him alone.

Obstruction of justice? Up to special counsel Mueller to ""sort that out"" 

Comey did testify that he didn't believe Trump was asking Comey to stop the broader Russia investigation being conducted by the FBI and that while his conversation with Trump was ""disturbing,"" he didn't ""think it's for me to say that the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct.""

Later asked by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., whether Trump's interactions with him over Flynn rose to the level of obstruction of justice, Comey responded that was newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller's ""job to sort that out.""

Comey said he had seen Trump's tweet last month suggesting that the president had ""tapes"" of their conversations — and that if those did exist, they would corroborate his testimony.

""Lordy, I hope there are tapes,"" he told senators.

And, Comey revealed, it was Trump's tweet about those alleged tapes that prompted him to call up a friend to leak the memos about his conversations with the president to the press last month in hopes that doing so would lead to the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.

Republicans have already seized on one section of Comey's written testimony as vindication. The former FBI director does detail in his written submission to the committee how he told Trump on three occasions that the president was not himself under investigation — a surprising assertion that Trump had put in his termination letter to Comey.

Comey told the committee that deliberations with senior FBI leadership about whether to tell the president he was not personally under investigation beginning in January, before he was inaugurated, were not unanimous.

""One of the members of the leadership team had a view that although it was technically true, we did not have a counterintelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump, his concern was that because we're looking at the potential — again that's the subject of the investigation — coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was President Trump — President-elect Trump's campaign, this person's view was inevitably his behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work. And so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made. I disagreed,"" Comey said. ""I thought it was fair to say what was literally true — there is not a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump — and I decided in the moment to say it given the nature of our conversation.""

He later confirmed that when he was let go on May 9, there was no counterintelligence nor criminal investigation of Trump individually and that the president was not personally under investigation.

Asked by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., as to whether he believed Trump colluded with Russia during the campaign, Comey responded, ""I don't think I should answer in an open setting."" Following his open hearing with members of the intelligence committee, Comey went into a closed briefing with senators.

Comey did underscore that while there was plenty of evidence that Russians meddled in the 2016 election, he was confident that no votes were altered.

However, he also said Trump never asked him what the FBI was doing to investigate the Russian meddling or to stop it from happening again in future elections. Comey said he fully expected Russian mischief in U.S. elections to resume in subsequent electoral cycles.

Comey was also pressed by Republicans on the committee, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, about why he didn't alert White House officials or the White House Counsel's Office about what he believed were inappropriate conversations with Trump and a breach of protocol.

""I don't know,"" Comey responded to Rubio. ""I think the circumstances were such that I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind.""

Comey critical of Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch 

Republicans also pressed Comey on how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 campaign, usurping then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch by announcing the FBI was not recommending prosecution for the handling of classified information on Clinton's private server.

Comey testified he was disturbed by Lynch's tarmac meeting with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, and that was one reason he made his announcement in July, though he did say at that time he believed Hillary Clinton had been careless with classified information.

""I didn't believe she could credibly decline that investigation, at least not without grievous damage to the Department of Justice and the FBI,"" Comey said of President Barack Obama's attorney general.

Comey said it made him uncomfortable that Lynch had directed him to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a ""matter"" and not an investigation, even though she was, indeed, under criminal investigation.

Pressed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as to why he didn't call for an independent counsel to handle that matter, Comey said that he ""knew there was no case there"" and that ""calling for a special counsel would be brutally unfair.""

Republicans push back that Trump has been ""vindicated"" 

The president did not immediately respond directly to Comey's testimony and has not tweeted, as many people speculated he might. However, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. did largely live-tweet the event.

1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear ""I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job""

2/3 very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction!

3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he ""orders or tells"" you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means

Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that. #givemeabreak

And Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's personal lawyer regarding the Russia inquiries, underscored in a statement that Comey did confirm what Trump has long asserted — that the former FBI director assured the president he was not under investigation.

""[Comey] also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference. Mr. Comey's testimony also makes clear that the President never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election, and in fact, according to Mr. Comey, the President told Mr. Comey 'it would be good to find out' in that investigation if there were 'some ""satellite"" associates of his who did something wrong.' And he did not exclude anyone from that statement,"" Kasowitz said.

Kasowitz also claimed that Trump never told Comey he needed loyalty from him ""in any form or substance,"" even though the president ""is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration.""

And he raised alarm over Comey's admission that he had encouraged a friend to leak his memos about his conversations with the president to the press, suggesting those were privileged communications.

""We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated,"" Kasowitz said.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan defended Trump at his weekly press conference, arguing that one reason the president had unusual conversations with Comey was because he was a novice president learning the ropes.

""Of course there needs to be a degree of independence between DOJ, FBI and the White House and a line of communications established. The president is new at this. He's new to government. So he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses,"" Ryan said. ""He's just new to this.""

Ryan was pushed by a reporter who asked how being new is an acceptable excuse when he has staff and legal counsel.

""I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse, it's just my observation,"" the Wisconsin Republican replied.

""I think people now realize why the president is so frustrated,"" Ryan added. ""When the FBI director tells him on three different occasions he's not under investigation yet the speculation swirls around the political system that he is, that's frustrating. Of course the president is frustrated, and I think the American people now know why he was so frustrated.""

"""Goats and Soda: Stories of Life in a Changing World.""

That's the name of NPR's new blog, covering health and all sorts of development around the world.

You may be thinking: ""Goats? Soda? This blog is going to look at communicable diseases, education struggles, sanitation concerns ... and it's called 'Goats and Soda'?""

We considered many names. A few seemed promising but fell short. Unarrested Development? Globelandia? Up the Road? They were too long, too hard to say on the radio or too vague.

Then Anders Kelto, a radio reporter on our team who's been based in South Africa for the past four years, proposed: ""Goats and Soda.""

Traveling about in Africa, he saw a lot of goats. And a lot of soda. ""In rural southern Malawi, I came across a roadside snack shop in the middle of nowhere. The woman running the shop somehow had a refrigerator full of cold sodas. It struck me that a rather amazing sequence of events had led to that cold Coke in my hand.""

We liked the name. It's lively. It's down to earth. And it's definitely original. A google search for ""Goats and Soda"" yielded zero results.

Then we had to ask ourselves: Does this name really make sense as a title for our blog? And will it cause any concerns?

Goats and soda, as it turns out, are complicated icons. In many parts of the world, goats are a force for positive change. Dozens of charities give goats to poor families to provide nutrition and/or income. But Leo Horn-Phathanothai, director for international cooperation at the World Resources Institute, points out that such donations can make it seem ""as if good things only happen to people as a result of beneficent actions by big-hearted foreigners.""

""The name is creative and unique and not rude,"" says Wilbur Sargunaraj, who posts his clever videos about life in India on YouTube. ""But I think you should be aware that many Indians are vegetarians and do not eat meat. An alternative could be 'Rice and Soda.' ""

As for soda, we all know it has been linked to obesity, an emerging health issue in many middle-income countries, such as Mexico and China. Yet global health workers are envious of the fact that Big Soda knows how to get its product to the remotest spots and keep it cold. That's what global health workers would like to do with vaccines. The English nonprofit group ColaLife explores the use of sodalike strategies to keep medicines on ice.

So that's a little bit about what's in our name. We know that it will have detractors – and we hope it will have fans as well.

""I love the name 'Goats and Soda,' "" says Kathryn Whetten, professor of public policy and global health at Duke University. ""It grabs the reader, creates a curiosity in what it means and how goats and soda can be related, and makes the person want to read more.""

And we hope that's what you do.

We're all neighbors on our tiny globe. The poor and the rich and everyone in between. We'll explore the downs and ups of life in this global village. And if you're curious about our name, Goats and Soda, here's the story.

"If you're not familiar with the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law, here is the most important thing to understand: Russian President Vladimir Putin and everyone in his orbit hates it.

""A purely political, unfriendly act,"" Putin called it at the time, and he has been railing against it ever since.

Congress wanted to punish Russian human rights abusers by barring them from entering the U.S. This followed the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died at age 37 in a Moscow prison where he was held — and allegedly beaten — after accusing Russian officials of massive tax fraud.

The law symbolized the deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Russia. Days after Congress passed it, the Russian parliament responded by banning American citizens from adopting Russian orphans.

In a bizarre 2013 trial, a Russian court went even further, convicting Magnitsky of tax fraud — four years after he died.

The Magnitsky Act re-emerged as a front-burner topic this week in connection with the investigations surrounding President Trump's campaign and possible links to Russian meddling in last year's presidential race.

Russia has lobbied hard for repeal of the act. That's what Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya said she was doing when she met with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York.

News broke Friday that she was accompanied at that meeting by Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin. He is known as a skilled political operator who has worked in both the former Soviet Union and the United States on behalf of his clients, according to a U.S. journalist who has known him for two decades.

Akhmetshin has also spoken freely about his past in Soviet military intelligence, according to the journalist, Steve Levine, who works for Axios in Washington.

However, in remarks to The Associated Press, Akhmetshin said he served in a military unit that was part of counterintelligence but was not trained as a spy.

Levine first encountered Akhmetshin in Kazakhstan. There, in 1998, he provided Levine with confidential banking and legal documents pointing to financial corruption by the country's president.

""His signature is to be able to drill very, very deeply in the former Soviet Union, in a very knowing way,"" Levine said. ""Here in Washington, he's this very unusual character, who may be the most skilled lobbyist I've met.""

Akhmetshin is, he added, ""someone who can ingratiate himself with members of Congress and their staffs, power figures here, and make things happen.""

Levine said they've been in touch periodically over the years, including in brief email exchanges in recent days as Akhmetshin's name began to surface in media reports.

Akhmetshin, who has become a U.S. citizen, has aggressively lobbied against the Magnitsky Act. Just a few days after his meeting with Trump Jr. in New York last year, Akhmetshin was in Washington to promote a movie called The Magnitsky Act — Behind the Scenes.

The film was shown at the Newseum in Washington on June 13, 2016. It offers the Russian government's version of events and claims that Magnitsky was not mistreated by Russian authorities.

Trump Jr. has also said that — to his disappointment — last year's meeting with the Russians focused on the Magnitsky Act. Trump Jr. was told in advance the meeting would produce critical material on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. When the topic turned out to be the U.S. law, he considered it a waste of time.

Analysts have offered many theories on why Russia wanted to meddle in the U.S. presidential election: to undermine the credibility of the U.S. vote or to harm Hillary Clinton, whom Putin blamed for the protests leading up the Russian presidential election in 2012.

Rarely mentioned is the Magnitsky Act, a relatively obscure matter inside the U.S. but a major frustration for Russia's leadership.

Before George Papadopoulos became the first legal casualty of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia and the 2016 election, he was a 30-year-old energy lawyer best known in D.C. for getting name-dropped by Donald Trump and for reportedly embellishing his resume.

The Justice Department announced Monday that Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to FBI agents about a series of meetings he took and planned while he was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

The White House immediately sought to distance itself from Papadopoulos on Monday, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying his role within the campaign was ""extremely limited"" and that it was a ""volunteer position.""

A former Trump campaign official said much of the same to Axios's Jonathan Swan, shortly after the news broke.

""To be honest... I thought they were talking about George Gigicos (advance man on campaign) ... not because he could've possibly been involved with Russia but because he's the only guy with a Greek name that anyone knew on the campaign,"" the official said.

And Trump himself tweeted Tuesday morning, calling Papadopoulos a ""young, low level volunteer named George.""

....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!

That description however, doesn't jibe with the picture painted by the court documents unsealed on Monday or with Trump's own words from the campaign trail.

In a spring 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board, then-candidate Trump was asked about who was advising him on foreign policy. He began listing names, and listed Papadopoulos third, referring to him as an ""energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.""

The documents show Papadopoulos in touch with multiple ""high-ranking"" campaign officials once he was brought on board, and that he met with a professor with Russian ties who had promised to provide ""dirt"" on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as well as with a ""Russian national"" woman.

Papadopoulos also appears in an Instagram photo from March 2016, posted by Trump, with the caption ""Meeting with my national security team in #WashingtonDC.""

 Meeting with my national security team in #WashingtonDC. #Trump2016

A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Mar 31, 2016 at 7:09pm PDT

While Papadopoulos's interactions on behalf of the campaign on their face don't seem to have broken any laws, it was the fact that he allegedly lied about them to the FBI that got him into trouble. The charging documents say Papadopoulos mischaracterized the content and the timing of his interactions with both people mentioned.

It's not the first time his honesty has come into question.

The Washington Post reported in April 2016 that it appeared Papadopoulos had fluffed up his resume. Here's the Post's Karen DeYoung:

""George Papadopoulous, a 2009 graduate of DePaul University, has described himself in several lengthy published résumés as an oil and gas consultant and expert in eastern Mediterranean energy policy.

But his claim to have served for several years as a fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute was refuted by David Tell, Hudson senior fellow and director of public affairs, who said the institute's 'records indicate that Mr. Papadopoulos started here as an unpaid intern in 2011 and subsequently provided some contractual research assistance to one of our senior fellows.'

Papadopoulos also lists attendance as 'U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations.' Two people who were part of the delegation that year, including Antony Papadopoulos (no relation), current secretary general of the Geneva program, said they had no recollection of him being there.

He also cites the delivery of a keynote address at the 2008 annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Conference. The conference agenda that year noted Papadopoulos's participation on a youth panel with other students; it lists 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as the keynote speaker.""

When asked by the Post about the discrepancies, Papadopoulos replied:

""Is it true that the 'establishment GOP foreign policy advisers,' many of whom I've met, are confused why the presidential front runner chose a group of experts with regional, on the ground experience, with track records of getting deals done with governments, instead of relying on their failed policies they likely devised at Starbucks on Pennsylvania Ave? If so, I am very shocked.""

DePaul University professor Richard Farkas taught Papadopoulos less than a decade ago. He teaches classes in Russian politics and Russian foreign policy, and as NPR member station WBEZ's Dave McKinney reports, Papadopoulos graduated from DePaul in 2009.

""I don't recall him being an outstanding student,"" said Farkas, who also described Papadopoulos as ""zealous and a bit simple.""

Farkas added that he was skeptical Papadopoulos had any real high-level contacts in the Russian government.

""There's no likelihood he could access it effectively. I think he probably was just embellishing,"" said Farkas, who has taught at DePaul for more than 40 years. ""I've been teaching about this part of the world and know people in Moscow. I don't think I could access people at that level, not at least without really working it.""

More recently, Papadopoulos worked as the director of the Center for International Energy and Natural Resources Law & Security at the London Centre of International Law Practice. NPR found a cache'd version of the institution's website that listed Papadopoulos on a staff list as recently as April 14, 2016. He seemed to be wiped from the list by May of that year.

An inquiry to the institute about Papadopoulos's employment status and history was not immediately returned Monday.

Over the past two years, Papadopoulos has also voiced his opinions on foreign policy in media reports, written by himself and others.

In an interview with the Jerusalem Post in April 2016, Papadopoulos said Trump viewed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""responsible actor and potential partner."" He added that Trump could ""ally"" with Putin on combating radical and violent Islam in the Middle East.

Prior to joining the Trump camp, Papadopoulos also advised Republican Ben Carson's campaign. He was laid off shortly after the Iowa caucuses, reports CBS, after working for Carson for about seven weeks.

"Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page told a number of his campaign colleagues and supervisors about his dealings with Russians, he told members of Congress last week.

One of them was Jeff Sessions, then an Alabama senator and early Trump endorser and now the attorney general. Sessions has denied he was aware of anyone in the campaign communicating or dealing with Russians who were interfering with the election.

Page's disclosure increases the pressure on Sessions ahead of a hearing scheduled for next week before the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats have howled about recent news in the Russia imbroglio that appears to contradict Sessions' long-standing claims that he didn't know about the overtures from Russia to people in the Trump campaign.

The new details come from Page's closed-door testimony last week with the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia's interference in last year's election. The panel reached an agreement with Page to release the transcript of his interview to the public, and the committee posted the transcript online late Monday.

Page's comments provide the latest confirmed contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russians during the presidential race. He is at least the second member of the foreign policy team contacted by Russians with offers of help or meetings.

Another adviser at the same time that Page joined the campaign, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Papadopoulos and Page both served as members of candidate Donald Trump's foreign policy committee.

Papadopoulos also told his superiors on the campaign that he was being offered ""dirt"" on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and ""off the record"" meetings with Russian leaders — which, according to court documents, he was encouraged to pursue.

The case of Page, an energy consultant and graduate of the Naval Academy, has attracted scrutiny since he was named an adviser to the campaign in March 2016.

For more than a year, questions have swirled about a trip Page made to Moscow in July 2016 during which he delivered a commencement speech at the New Economic School, a Moscow university. Page then traveled back to Russia after Election Day last year.

Page addressed some of the questions about those trips in more than seven hours of testimony last week to the House committee.

Page said that before heading to Moscow, he informed then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski along with communications director Hope Hicks and J.D. Gordon, who was managing the candidate's national security team. Hicks is now the White House communications director.

For months, Page has denied meeting with Russian government officials while in Moscow. But according to the transcript, he told lawmakers that he did indeed speak with members of the Russian government and state-owned businesses, including Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich.

The two men had a brief interaction at the commencement ceremony, where Dvorkovich also spoke, Page said. Their conversation, he told investigators, was not about coordination with Russia on the campaign, but largely limited to an exchange of pleasantries.

Page offered the Trump campaign a ""readout"" about his trip, including the discussions with Russian officials.

He wrote to Gordon and Tera Dahl, a former columnist at Breitbart, that he would send them a memo ""regarding some incredible insights and outreach I've received from a few Russian legislators and senior members of the presidential administration here.""

The House panel's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, cited a memo Page sent campaign officials that quoted Page as writing ""in a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems.""

Page played down those comments, telling Schiff that his insights were drawn from listening to Dvorkovich's speech and public statements, and from reading the Russian press and watching Russian television.

Page also acknowledged to members of Congress that he has had at least four meetings with the FBI related to the Russia investigation. He denies any wrongdoing and says that he has been the subject of a witch hunt.

President Trump also calls the Russia investigation a witch hunt and has repeatedly said there was no collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin.

A previous version of this story incorrectly gave Arkady Dvorkovich's first name as Andriy.

"Updated at 9 p.m. ET

Questions about the abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey swirled on Wednesday, but Comey himself reportedly told staff he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either.""

In a farewell letter, Comey said, according to CNN, ""It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply."" He added:

""It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution. If you do that, you too will be sad when you leave, and the American people will be safer.""

The White House continued to defend the firing, arguing that President Trump had ""been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.""

But there are new concerns about how Comey's role in overseeing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign affected the president's decision.

Days before he was fired, Comey asked for added resources for the FBI's Russia investigation, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly and Geoff Bennett report.

According to two Senate aides with knowledge of the investigation, Comey met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week to ask for significant added resources for the Russia investigation. On Monday, Comey briefed key senators about the request.

That was the same day that Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Trump to voice concerns about Comey's performance and waning confidence within the FBI. Trump asked the two ""to put that recommendation in writing,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday, but she denied that Trump had asked Rosenstein for a reason to fire Comey.

Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told NPR's Tamara Keith earlier on Wednesday that the reports that Comey had ""requested additional resources"" were ""totally false.""

In Rosenstein's memo to Sessions released Tuesday night, the deputy attorney general concluded that Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server justified his dismissal because Comey had refused to acknowledge what many viewed as mistakes in how and why Comey made public disclosures about the investigation at key moments in the presidential campaign.

""The FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department,"" Rosenstein wrote in the memorandum, which was forwarded by Sessions to the president.

Trump on Wednesday continued to defend his decision to fire Comey amid the growing firestorm, telling reporters in the Oval Office that ""he wasn't doing a good job.""

At the White House briefing later that afternoon, Huckabee Sanders said that Trump had lost confidence in Comey ""over the last several months"" and that ""he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.""

The White House did little to tamp down concerns about possible Russian influence though, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday while Lavrov was in Washington for a previously scheduled trip.

And after Trump's swift firing of Comey drew comparisons to President Richard Nixon's infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" the president then had another surprise visitor beside him as he spoke to reporters — former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

The administration's position remains that Trump took action against Comey after recommendations from Rosenstein and Sessions, even though Sessions had to recuse himself from the Russia investigation being conducted by the FBI.

Lavrov's visit to the White House to meet with the president also included Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak — who spoke with Michael Flynn, Trump's short-lived national security adviser, during the transition late last year and also had contacts with then-Sen. Sessions during the campaign. Those contacts with Kislyak played a role in Flynn's ultimate resignation from his job at the White House and in Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing the FBI's Russia investigation.

On Capitol Hill, Vice President Mike Pence denied that Russia was a motivating factor in Trump's decision.

""The president took strong and decisive leadership here to put the safety and security of the American people first,"" Pence said.

However, the vice president skirted questions about whether Trump had asked Rosenstein to conduct the review of Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation.

The White House has struggled to square Trump's past praise for Comey with the sudden termination. During the campaign, Trump praised Comey and said his decision to reopen the investigation less than two weeks before Election Day took ""guts.""

Huckabee Sanders argued Wednesday that what Trump said as a candidate and now as president ""are two very different things.""

""Having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic atrocities in circumventing the chain of command"" in the Clinton investigation is what led to his dismissal, she maintained, and she compared Comey's actions to ""throwing a stick of dynamite"" into the Justice Department.

NPR's Carrie Johnson reported last November that Trump's advisers were considering whether to keep Comey as FBI director.

Huckabee Sanders stressed that the White House wants the Justice Department to continue its investigation into Russia and the election so that it can move on from the issue.

""Whatever investigation was happening on Monday is happening today,"" she said.

Clinton and other Democrats have said they believe that Comey's controversial decision to reopen the investigation helped tip the election to Trump — and it was those statements Republicans began to seize upon on Wednesday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the termination, noting how harshly Democrats criticized Comey's handling of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's private email server.

Reporter: Does the Comey firing cast a shadow over your talks?Lavrov: ""Was he fired? You're kidding."" https://t.co/EA1e2llZNx

""Last year, the current Democratic leader said it appeared to be an appalling act,"" McConnell said from the Senate floor. ""One that he said goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan — who waited more than 24 hours after Comey's firing to weigh in — went on Fox News Wednesday evening to defend the president's actions.

""It is entirely within the president's role and authority to relieve him, and that's what he did,"" Ryan told Fox News' Bret Baier.

Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, tried to shift the focus away from the Clinton email investigation and onto the current FBI investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election as well as possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""There is little reason to think that Mr. Rosenstein's reason is the true reason that President Trump fired Director Comey,"" Schumer said Wednesday, responding to McConnell in the Senate chamber. ""Why? Because if the administration truly had objections to the way Director Comey handled the investigation, they would have had them the minute the president got into office. But he didn't fire Director Comey then.

""The question is: Why did it happen last night?""

Schumer continued a near-universal call from Democrats for a special prosecutor to take over the FBI's Russia investigation, but McConnell called the suggestion unnecessary and said a new investigation would ""impede the current work being done"" by the FBI and by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday the White House didn't believe a special prosecutor was necessary.

Before he met with Trump, Lavrov appeared to mock the kerfuffle over Comey's firing. During a photo-op with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a reporter yelled out a question about whether Comey's firing ""casts a shadow"" on Lavrov's visit. Lavrov scoffed and walked away dismissively.

""Was he fired?"" Lavrov said. ""You're kidding!""

And prior to McConnell's and Schumer's remarks on the Senate floor, the president was predictably on Twitter sounding off about his decision to get rid of the FBI director. ""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike."" Trump tweeted, ""When things calm down, they will be thanking me!""

"One of two Milwaukee-area girls charged in the 2014 attempted murder of a classmate to impress a fictional horror character known as ""Slender Man"" was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in a mental hospital.

Anissa Weier, 16, had pleaded guilty in August to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide. However, a jury agreed in September with her claim that she was not responsible for her actions because of mental illness.

The finding by the jury ensured that Weier, now 16, would be sent to a mental hospital for not less than three years. The sentence of 25 years is the maximum under the circumstances.

The bizarre case centered on classmates Weier, now 16, Morgan Geyser, who is now 15, and victim Payton Leutner. As member station WUWM in Milwaukee reports, in spring 2014, when all three girls were 12, Geyser and Weier ""attacked [Leutner] in the woods in Waukesha, leaving her to die. The victim was able to crawl from the site of the attack and flag down a bicyclist who came to her aid.""

""Weier and ... Geyser said they planned the stabbing in order to please the Internet horror character Slender Man. Attorneys for Weier argued that she believed Slender Man would harm her family if she did not attack her classmate,"" according to WUWM.

According to the criminal complaint filed in 2014, one of the girls said, ""Many people do not believe Slender Man is real,"" and that the girls ""wanted to prove the skeptics wrong.""

The two were tried as adults.

Geyser pleaded guilty in September in a deal that would also have her committed to a mental institution, rather than going to prison.

Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren sentenced Weier retroactive to the date of the crime, meaning she will be institutionalized until age 37, The Associated Press reports.

Before her sentencing, Weier issued an apology for the crime. ""I do hold myself accountable for this and that I will do whatever I have to do to make sure I don't get any sort of delusion or whatever again,"" she said.

""I want everybody involved to know I deeply regret everything that happened that day. I know that nothing I say is going to make this right and nothing I say is going to fix what I broke,"" Weier said.

Geyser's sentencing is scheduled for February. During testimony in October, she broke down in tears.

""Anissa and I took [Leutner] in the forest and said that we were going to play hide-and-seek,"" Geyser said, crying. ""Anissa said that she couldn't do it and that I had to.""

Bohren asked how Geyser carried out the attack, to which she replied: ""I tackled her. I stabbed her.""

Where? Bohren asked. ""Everywhere,"" Geyser replied. How many times? ""19.""

""Anissa told her to lie down so she wouldn't lose blood so quickly, and told her to be quiet, and we left,"" Geyser said.

"Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton argued Wednesday that Russian meddling in the 2016 election in large part cost her the White House, and said she was ""leaning"" toward believing that President Trump's campaign did, indeed, collude with the Russians.

During an interview at Recode's Code Conference, Clinton argued that the Russians ""could not have known how best to weaponize"" damaging information about her campaign and fake news stories perpetrated on social media unless they had been ""guided"" by Americans.

Multiple investigations into potential ties between Trump associates and Russia, as well as Russian interference in the U.S. election, are ongoing.

Clinton's latest comments continue a postelection emergence in which the former Democratic nominee continues to point fingers for her loss, though other accounts of the Clinton campaign have put more fault in her corner.

Trump tweeted Wednesday night that she ""blamed everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate.""

Clinton's response: ""People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe.""

At the conference, Clinton said her campaign's assertions that there was Russian meddling had been ""basically shooed away.""

"" 'There she goes, ""vast right-wing conspiracy."" ' Now it's a vast Russian conspiracy,"" she said. ""It turned out we were right, and we saw evidence of it.""

The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia attempted to interfere in the election in an effort to get Trump elected, though there so far has been no evidence of collusion with the Trump team. Former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers last month that he was concerned about contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, but he said he didn't know if ""collusion existed.""

In addition to her Russia comments, Clinton on Wednesday said stories about her controversial private email server while at the State Department were overblown, calling it ""the biggest nothing-burger ever.""

""It was a mistake. I've said it was a mistake,"" she added. ""And obviously, if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn't have done it in the first place. But the way that it was used was very damaging.""

Trump brought up the server regularly on the campaign trail.

Clinton said she takes responsibility for mistakes made by her campaign, but echoed comments she's made since the election as well — that she was on a trajectory toward winning until then-FBI Director James Comey released a letter less than two weeks before Election Day saying that he was re-examining her email investigation.

""Comey was more than happy to talk about my emails, but he wouldn't talk about the Russians,"" she said.

Comey has testified that it makes him ""mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election."" But he defended his handling of both investigations, saying that not disclosing that they were reopening the investigation just before the election would have jeopardized the FBI's independence and that the Russia investigation, which began last summer, was treated ""consistently under the same principles"" as the Clinton email probe.

Trump fired Comey last month, initially citing how he handled the investigation into Clinton's email server as the impetus. However, the president later said the Russia investigation played a role.

Even with that last-minute October surprise, Clinton said she still believed she was going to win — and that perhaps that was why the warnings about Russia's involvement seemed to fall on deaf ears.

""I also think I was the victim of the very broad assumption I was going to win. I never believed it, I always thought it would be a close election,"" she said.

But her campaign ultimately saw measurable drops with female voters in the suburbs of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in particular, Clinton said.

""I knew that I'd taken a tremendous hit after the Comey letter and later I understood the role that WikiLeaks played in it. But the Comey letter was measurable,"" she said. ""You could see my drop.""

However, pollsters have said that ""there is at best mixed evidence to suggest that the FBI announcement tipped the scales of the race."" And the new book Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign details how many early missteps ultimately hurt her campaign.

Clinton has pointed fingers before at Comey for contributing to her loss. And in a commencement address last week at her alma mater, Wellesley College, she jabbed more directly at Trump and the controversies engulfing his administration.

But on Wednesday she unleashed her harshest blame yet against her own party, claiming the Democratic National Committee was vastly unprepared for the 2016 election when it came to data-gathering compared to the GOP's robust operation.

""I set up my campaign and we have our own data operation. I get the nomination, so I'm now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherited nothing from the Democratic Party,"" she said.

""I mean, it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong,"" Clinton added.

Despite ordering an ""influence campaign"" to help Donald Trump in last year's election, the Kremlin is scrambling to respond to a win it didn't expect, New Yorker editor David Remnick and staff writer Evan Osnos tell Fresh Air's Terry Gross.

Remnick, who lived and worked in Moscow from 1988 to 1992, and Osnos say Trump's victory has created unintended consequences for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""This was like a bank heist that, instead of blowing the doors off the safe, they blew the safe up entirely,"" Osnos says.

Remnick adds that Russia's state-controlled media, which was full of praise for Trump during the campaign, has changed its outlook of late: ""We've now had a month of chaos, and they've decided to take much more of a wait-and-see attitude.""

Osnos and Remnick collaborated with contributor Joshua Yaffa to report on Trump, Putin and the ""new Cold War"" for the current issue of The New Yorker. The title of their article, ""Active Measures,"" is a reference to the type of intelligence operation in which the goal is to take active measures to influence events and undermine a rival power.

On why the White House's response to the DNC hacking was ""muted"" 

Osnos: There was a robust, a really intense debate going on within the White House and the national security community about what the best response would be. In September the Obama White House went to Mitch McConnell and said, ""Look, we believe that the Russians were involved and that they may be threatening the integrity of the vote,"" and they said, ""We want to issue a bipartisan statement that would encourage state voting authorities to keep an extra eye on the security and integrity of the vote."" Basically a bipartisan gesture, and Mitch McConnell, this is now public, he has said that he would regard that as a partisan gesture.

That was one of the reasons ... why the Obama White House was reluctant to go too far in being very public about this. There are people in Hillary Clinton's camp who, one of whom was quoted in our article, saying, ""We look back and wonder why this was not"" — in the words of this person — ""a five-alarm fire in the White House.""

On Russian TV news coverage of Trump and his administration

Remnick: I've been watching Russian TV a lot, which you can do really easily on YouTube. Initially, there was great celebration, enormous celebration. Champagne corks popping. People going on the air and saying, ""Ding dong, the witch is dead,"" practically, and showing great enthusiasm for Trump because Trump, of course, has been incredibly complimentary of Putin, says much nicer things about Vladimir Putin than Barack Obama or anybody else.

But now, things are different. We've now had a month of chaos. We've had the Michael Flynn firing or resignation. Suddenly the order goes to Russian television, which is completely under Putin's control, ""Enough about Trump. Enough compliments. Let's play it down. Let's take it easy.""

On differing perceptions of the end of the Soviet Union

Remnick: What I witnessed was the dissolution of an empire, these 15 republics going each their own way, the end of Communist ideology and the rise of things like a free press and artistic freedom — and the rise of politics, actual politics, of competition of ideas and the filth and tumult that that all brings, and it was incredibly exciting.

I think most Westerners experienced it and many Russian intellectuals and people of the rising, the nascent, middle class and educated people in particular, and people in cities, they experienced it largely as a great passage forward in history. And we forget that even then ... a lot of people were made deeply anxious about this.

A Cold War, which had been fought for two generations, had been lost. This was experienced not as a triumph by so many, but also as an incredibly disorienting, humiliating passage of history in which the great empire had disintegrated. ... An economic depression came along that, for many people, was incredibly painful, like the '30s in the United States. ... A lot of people in Russia, exemplified by Putin, saw this as a crash followed by chaos, followed by poverty.

On Trump's calling the press the ""enemy of the American people"" 

Remnick: It goes back to Robespierre. [""Enemy of the people""] is an ugly, ugly phrase. I don't know how self-aware Donald Trump is of that kind of phrase. I guarantee that Steve Bannon knows what ""enemy of the people"" means. Stalin used it to keep people terrified. If you were branded a vrag naroda, an ""enemy of the people,"" you could guarantee that very soon there would be a knock in the middle of the night at your door and your fate would be horrific.

To hear that kind of language directed at the American press is an emergency. It's an emergency. It's not a political tactic, and if it's a political tactic, it's a horrific one and that needs to be resisted, not just by people like me who are editors or writers — but all of us. This is part of what distinguishes American democracy and it is untenable, immoral and anti-American.

"Donald Trump Jr.'s emails about Russian help for his father's campaign revealed a great deal about the imbroglio over the meddling in the 2016 election — but they also raised as many questions as they answered.

Trump Jr.'s bid for ""transparency"" laid out the whos, wheres, whats and hows, but left out some critical details.

For all the revelations that were contained within the Trump Jr. bombshell — the Russian government's offer of help, the Trump team's willingness to accept it and the primary confirmation of direct contact between the two sides — here are five questions to which there aren't yet tidy answers.

1. Who was the second person in the meeting?

The Russian government used intermediaries of Family Trump to offer ""high level, confidential"" information about Hillary Clinton that it believed would damage her and help Donald Trump be elected, as Trump Jr.'s correspondent wrote him. To that end, the emails say the Russian government dispatched attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya on a special trip from Moscow to New York for the meeting.

But Trump Jr.'s emails also include this promise: ""I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today.""

So a second person was there for this meeting. The email messages describe Veselnitskaya flying from Moscow to New York for the session, suggesting the second person was someone apparently already in New York City.

Who was it?

Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya have denied in separate statements that she actually had any dirt on Clinton. Even if that is so, neither of them have talked much about this other person. Veselnitskaya has suggested it was an interpreter to convey in English what she wanted to say in Russian to Trump Jr., campaign chairman Paul Manafort and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya have confined their remarks about the meeting to each other and the other Trump employees — but more detail about the second person could offer additional clues about the nature of Moscow's overtures to the Trumps.

Was the person from the Russian Consulate in New York? A Foreign Ministry diplomat there to convey official assurances? Or was the person an intelligence officer there to give Moscow an independent account of what took place? Or was it simply someone Veselnitskaya hired for the day to serve as her interpreter?

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, suggested on Tuesday that the meeting described in Trump Jr.'s emails was ""consistent with Russian tradecraft."" But it isn't clear yet whether it was a venue to actually pass the dirt on Clinton or just a test to see whether the Trumps would let Veselnitskaya in the door or call the FBI.

2. How many other direct discussions took place between the Trump camp and the Russians?

Veselnitskaya and the second person visited Trump Jr. in New York City in June of last year. Trump Jr. told Fox News on Tuesday evening that he never spoke with Veselnitskaya again.

But the following month, Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page made a visit to Moscow. While there, he gave a speech about Western hypocrisy in international affairs. Did he also use that trip to meet with Russian intelligence officials or government leaders?

There has been a great deal of speculation about Page's visit and his broader role in this Russia saga. The New York Times reported in April that U.S. law enforcement officials looked into Page's connections to an officer in Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR. Ultimately, the Times reported, the FBI concluded at the time that Page hadn't become a Russian agent.

If he had pre-existing connections with the Russian government, however — as did Manafort and a few other Trump aides — did the campaign send Page to Moscow in July to follow up on whatever Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner discussed with the delegation they had hosted the month before?

There have also been other suggestions that Trump aides might have communicated electronically with Russians: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked former FBI Director James Comey when he appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee whether the Americans had used encryption to conceal their messages from the U.S. intelligence community and whether they might have destroyed evidence of those communications.

""That's not a question I can answer in an open setting,"" Comey said.

As for Page's personal trip to Russia, it took place the same month, Comey later told Congress, that the FBI had begun its counterintelligence investigation into potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Page has used TV and other appearances more recently to deny any inappropriate contacts with Russia.

3. How much did the Russians tell the Trumps about their other schemes, including the cyberattacks? And how much guidance did they request?

Trump Jr.'s email revealed that Russia's top government prosecutor, Yuri Chaika, wanted to use a series of cutouts to communicate information about Clinton to the Trumps to give them a hand in the election.

Chaika didn't want to talk directly to Trump. Instead, he spoke to a Moscow developer who helped Trump stage the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. The developer spoke to his son. He spoke to his publicist, who then sent the email to Trump Jr. laying out the connection.

All this took place in June. But Comey told members of Congress that Russia's cyberattacks — against as many as a thousand targets in the U.S. — began as early as late 2015.

If the Trump campaign was in communication with the Russian government by June, did the Russians tell whomever they spoke with that they also had already begun a separate offensive against the United States? Or did the intelligence bosses at the SVR and its siblings — the military GRU and the more domestic-focused FSB — decide to ""compartmentalize,"" as spies say, how much they told the Trumps?

There were overt indications at about this same time that Russian President Vladimir Putin was supporting Trump. The Russian leader had said in December 2015 that Trump was ""colorful"" and ""talented,"" and Trump later said Putin called him ""a genius.""

Plus Russia's state media were supporting Trump. Political analyst Aleksandr Dugin, dubbed ""Putin's Rasputin,"" endorsed Trump in the early summer and used some of his TV and YouTube commentaries to make the Russian case for why he would be a better president.

There are some indications that people in the Trump orbit were told at least something about the GRU's scheme: Adviser Roger Stone famously wrote on Twitter that Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, would soon have his ""time in the barrel,"" before WikiLeaks published Podesta's emails.

The U.S. intelligence community says Russian intelligence hacked Podesta's email and used WikiLeaks and other intermediaries to fence the release of the information. Stone has acknowledged that some middleman told him about WikiLeaks' plans, but he denied he had any inside knowledge about Russia's meddling.

Trump Jr.'s emails, however, show the care the Russian government took in using three or four steps' worth of connections, including no one who was technically a Russian government employee, to connect with the Trump campaign. And Trump Jr. not only said ""I love it"" in response to the Russian overtures, but he also said ""particularly later in the summer"" — in other words, not only do we want dirt on Clinton, but also having it at a specific time would help us.

How much other such communication took place and what roles were any other Trump aides playing in helping the GRU or others conduct their cyberattack on the United States?

4. Have the Russians turned on the Trumps?

Members of Congress and international commentators have warned over and over that Putin is not a Republican or a Democrat — what he wants is to sow chaos and expose what he calls the hypocrisy of a West that loves to preach to Russia but he views as just as venal.

In practical terms, Moscow hasn't actually gotten much from Trump and the West since the election: American sanctions remain in place — and could be strengthened under a new bill. American military deployments to Eastern Europe have continued. American support for Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2014, has endured.

So does that mean Putin has decided to keep the United States off balance by fueling more political fires in Washington between the Republican and Democratic leaders, who are so strongly at odds over Trump and Russia?

The White House and the Justice Department have suggested that some of the unnamed sources in the explosive press reports about Trump might not be Americans, and the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are holding a cache of material about Republicans like the one they compiled about Democrats. Will they begin to release it?

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and other leaders warned Congress that Russian hackers breached older GOP servers at the same time they had compromised the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee. So whatever material the Russians gleaned, it might be less current and less embarrassing than what they released about the Democrats.

But the Russians have another ace to play if they want to use it: They know everything about their dealings with the Trump campaign team and are in a position to reveal what they know when and if they choose.

That was the dilemma about which then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates rushed to warn White House counsel Don McGahn about: The Russians knew then-national security adviser Mike Flynn hadn't told the truth about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and that, among other things, opened him up to the threat of blackmail.

5. How much did Trump know about it all?

The president goes back and forth about what he acknowledges and what he ridicules. He has said both that he accepts the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Russia attacked the election and that the whole thing is a ""witch hunt."" He said that he pitched Putin the idea of a joint, ""impenetrable"" U.S.-Russian cybersecurity unit, then said later that day it would not happen.

Trump Jr. told Fox's Sean Hannity on Tuesday that he never told his father about the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the White House says Trump didn't learn about any of this until Kushner updated his security disclosures with the latest details.

Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred reporters' questions about what Trump knew and when to the outside attorneys who have been enlisted to help manage the imbroglio.

Is it plausible that the president's eldest son, campaign chairman and son-in-law — who continues to serve as a top White House adviser — never told Trump about the Russian overtures? At least one point from the chronology suggests they did: Then-candidate Trump promised he would deliver ""a major speech"" attacking Clinton later in the same day that Trump Jr. scheduled his meeting with the Russians who had promised him dirt on her.

The younger Trump insisted to Hannity that this story is overblown and that, as he maintains, nothing actually came of it. He did, however, acknowledge that it has put the family in something of a jam.

""In retrospect,"" he said, ""I probably would have done things a little differently.""

"Updated at 12:20 p.m. ET

President Trump begrudgingly signed into law new sanctions against Russia  that had been approved by overwhelming majorities in Congress. The move is in contrast to his frequently stated desire to improve relations with the country. The president also issued a signing statement on Wednesday in which he declared that the legislation has a number of what he deems to be ""unconstitutional provisions.""

The sanctions bill targets Russia's mining and oil industry and aims to punish the country for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election as well for its military aggression in Ukraine. In announcing that he had signed the bill, Trump made his most definitive statement yet about Russia's interference in the election.

""I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization,"" he said.

He also said, however, that he has a number of qualms with the ""seriously flawed"" bill — most notably with the fact that it restricts his ability to ease sanctions without Congress' involvement. To waive sanctions, Trump has to send Congress a report explaining and justifying his decision, and lawmakers would then get 30 days to decide whether to allow the waiver.

""The bill remains seriously flawed — particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate,"" Trump said, adding, ""The Framers of our Constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has already announced retaliation for the sanctions: The U.S. has to cut its embassy and consulate staffs in Russia by 755 people by Sept. 1.

""It's impossible to endlessly tolerate this kind of insolence toward our country,"" Putin said of the sanctions at a news conference on July 27.

The bill also applies new sanctions to Iran and North Korea.

Questions had been raised about whether Trump would sign the sanctions bill because he has spoken so overtly and so frequently about wanting to improve relations with Moscow. By the time the legislation got to his desk, however, Congress had left him with little choice; both chambers had passed the bill with veto-proof bipartisan majorities. The House passed it 419-3, and the Senate voted in favor 98-2.

Multiple congressional committees and a Department of Justice special counsel are all investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links between top Trump campaign aides and Russia. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russian intelligence services, acting at Putin's direction, conducted cyberattacks aimed at helping Trump during the campaign. The president has repeatedly denied that he or anyone involved in his campaign colluded with Russia, and Putin has repeatedly denied that the Russian government had any role in the hacking of emails and their strategic release at key moments during last year's presidential race.

Notwithstanding the multiple investigations and the cloud that Russian interference has cast over Trump's presidency so far, the two leaders have seemed to be developing a friendly relationship. After Trump and Putin met on July 7 in Hamburg, Germany, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the pair had a ""clear positive chemistry"" as they talked for more than triple the time that had been scheduled for the meeting.

""There was such a level of engagement and exchange,"" Tillerson said, that ""neither one of them wanted it to stop.""

It was later disclosed that Trump had had another reportedly hourlong conversation with Putin at the same global summit without the presence of any of his staff or even an interpreter.

This sanctions bill is likely to affect the relationship between the two men and their two countries. The White House at first hedged about whether Trump would sign it but then released a statement saying the president intended to sign the bill — putting to rest questions about whether Trump would force Congress to override a veto.

Vice President Pence also voiced support for the sanctions and criticized Russia during a visit to the Baltics this week.

""At this very moment, Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracy in sovereign nations and divide the free nations of Europe, one against another,"" Pence said at a press conference in Estonia on Monday, according to CNN.

Pence also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the defense of NATO countries as part of the alliance's mutual defense agreement.

But the vice president also said he was hopeful for ""better days, for better relations with Russia.""

The same goes for the American public. According to an NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist Poll released last month, a plurality of Americans thought Trump's goal of improving Russian relations was a ""mostly good thing.""

That poll was conducted, however, before details emerged about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting last year during the campaign with a Russian attorney, two Russian-Americans and two top aides of the Trump campaign.

According to emails released by Trump Jr. that detail plans for the gathering, the president's eldest son was told beforehand that the Russian attorney would be bringing incriminating information regarding Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton provided by the Russian government in order to help his father's presidential campaign. But Trump Jr. and the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, have both said that no such information about Clinton changed hands at the meeting.

"President Trump hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the White House on Wednesday, one day after firing the man whose agency is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election that brought Trump to power.

Trump fired now-former FBI Director James Comey, who told Congress earlier this year that his agency has been investigating Russia's actions — and possible ties to anyone associated with the Trump campaign — since July. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, the firing of Comey with more than six years left on his term in office has prompted a flurry of questions about the president's motives — and about what's next.

Lavrov's meeting with the president was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. ET, and it was declared closed to the press. Russian agencies tweeted photos from the Oval Office showing that in addition to Lavrov, Trump shook hands with Russia's ambassador to America, Sergey Kislyak — a key figure in the investigation into Trump's ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

After the Lavrov session had concluded, members of the U.S. media were allowed into the Oval Office, where they found the president sitting with Henry Kissinger, who served as President Richard Nixon's secretary of state. The meeting hadn't been listed on the president's official schedule.

Trump said he and Kissinger had met to talk ""about Russia and various other matters,"" according to the pool report.

To a question about Comey, Trump reportedly replied, ""He wasn't doing a good job. Very simply. He was not doing a good job.""

The president also said the issue had not affected his meeting with Lavrov.

Lavrov arrived in Washington on Tuesday. He met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the White House early Wednesday, ahead of his visit to the Oval Office.

Tillerson and Lavrov made a brief appearance Wednesday morning for a photo-op, and as Tillerson began to lead his guest back behind closed doors, Lavrov responded to a question about Comey's firing.

""Was he fired? You are kidding!"" – Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asked in US about ex-FBI chief James Comeyhttps://t.co/IrFi991lJz pic.twitter.com/xbEnYQJJsC

When a reporter asked whether the dismissal has ""cast a shadow"" over their talks, Lavrov stopped and seemed to look genuinely quizzical when he responded, ""Was he fired?"" — but then adopted a deadpan tone as he told the reporter, ""You are kidding, you are kidding.""

With a theatrical twitch of his head, the Russian diplomat then followed his American counterpart away from the media. The exchange was not included in the State Department's brief video snippet from the photo-op that it posted to Twitter.

Tillerson's office said his talks with Lavrov would focus on ""Ukraine, Syria, and bilateral issues."" But the Russians' visit to the White House also came as the Kremlin made its first public comments on Comey's removal.

When Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked how the firing might affect U.S.-Russia relations, Peskov replied, ""We hope that it will not affect them at all. That's the United States' internal affair. That's the U.S. president's independent decision, which has nothing to do and should have nothing to do with Russia.""

Comey's dismissal has sparked new calls for an independent probe into Russia's attempts to influence last year's U.S. presidential election — despite the Trump administration's assertion that Comey was removed over his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Announcing Comey's abrupt firing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president ""acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.""

"A day after President Trump said the Affordable Care Act ""has been repealed,"" officials reported that 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage on the federal insurance exchange for 2018 — nearly reaching the 2017 number in half the sign-up time.

That total is far from complete. Enrollment is still open in parts of seven states, including Florida and Texas, that use the federal HealthCare.gov exchange but were affected by hurricanes earlier this year.

The numbers released Thursday by the Department of Health and Human Services also did not include those who signed up between midnight Dec. 15 and 3 a.m. ET on Dec. 16, the final deadline for 2018 coverage, as well as those who could not finish enrolling before the deadline and left their phone number for a callback.

And enrollment has not closed in 11 states, including California and New York, as well as Washington, D.C., that run their own insurance exchanges. Those states are expected to add several million more enrollees.

The robust numbers for sign-ups on the federal exchange — 96 percent of last year's 9.2 million total — surprised both supporters and opponents of the health law, who almost universally thought the numbers would be lower. Not only was the sign-up period reduced by half, but the Trump administration also dramatically cut funding for advertising and enrollment aid. Republicans in Congress spent much of the year trying to repeal and replace the law, while Trump repeatedly declared the health law dead, leading to widespread confusion.

On the other hand, a Trump decision aimed at hurting the exchanges may have backfired. When he canceled federal subsidies to help insurers offer discounts to their lowest-income customers, it produced some surprising bargains for those who qualify for federal premium help. That may have boosted enrollment.

""Enrollment defied expectations and the Trump administration's efforts to undermine it,"" says Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration health official who joined with other Obama alumni to try to promote enrollment in the absence of federal outreach efforts. ""The demand for affordable coverage speaks volumes — proving yet again the staying power of the marketplaces.""

""The ACA is not repealed and not going away,"" tweeted Andy Slavitt, who oversaw the ACA under President Barack Obama.

The tax bill passed by Congress this week repeals the fines for those who fail to obtain health coverage, but those fines do not go away until 2019. Still, that has added to the confusion surrounding 2018 coverage.

And it remains unclear whether Congress will make another attempt to repeal the law in 2018.

""I think we'll probably move on to other issues,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview Thursday with NPR.

"A Georgia judge has sentenced Kayla Norton, 25, and Jose ""Joe"" Torres, 26, to spend a combined 19 years in prison for their role in a group's racist rampage at an 8-year-old's birthday party — an assault that included shouting racial slurs, making armed threats and waving Confederate battle flags.

""I'm so sorry that happened to you,"" Norton told the family that endured the assault, weeping in the courtroom at Monday's sentencing. ""I am so sorry.""

After telling the court that she accepted responsibility for her actions, Norton turned to the area of the courtroom where families who attended the birthday party were seated.

""But I want you all to know that that is not me,"" Norton told them. ""That is not me.""

Norton and Torres, who are not married, have three children together. Prosecutors say they were part of a gang of white supremacists who targeted African-Americans with racist taunts and threatened to murder minorities.

In court Monday, both Norton and Torres sat hunched over and crying after Superior Court Judge William ""Beau"" McClain handed down his sentence: 13 years in prison and seven years' probation for Torres, and six years in prison with nine years' probation for Norton. Both of them are also banished from Douglas County, McClain said.

The sentencing comes weeks after a jury found Torres and Norton guilty of making terroristic threats and violating the Georgia Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act. The jury also convicted Torres of aggravated assault. Although Georgia doesn't have a law specifying a hate crime, that's the term both McClain and District Attorney Brian Fortner used to describe the group's behavior.

The assault occurred in July 2015, one month after a racist gunman killed nine worshippers at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C. Prosecutors say Norton, Torres and other members of a group that called itself ""Respect the Flag"" went on an alcohol-fueled racist spree in Douglas and Paulding counties, west of Atlanta.

With Confederate battle flags affixed to the beds of their pickup trucks, the group gathered for a ride that was purportedly meant to celebrate the flag's heritage.

""However, Paulding County 911 began immediately receiving calls that members associated with this group were threatening African American citizens at various locations in Paulding County and hurling numerous racial slurs in the process as well,"" according to the Douglas County District Attorney's Office.

After threatening black motorists, the group headed to Douglasville, where they happened upon an outdoor birthday party that included a cookout and bouncy castle.

""Victims and witnesses from the party, who were predominantly African-American, testified to observing the group of trucks whose passengers were hurling a litany of racial slurs at them as they passed by,"" prosecutors said.

Several members of the group — some of whom are now serving prison terms of their own — got out of their trucks and approached the partygoers, threatening to kill them all. According to their fellow defendants and witnesses, it was Norton who retrieved Torres' shotgun — a tactical 12-gauge with a pistol grip — and loaded it before giving it to him.

Cellphone footage from the party shows police attempting to form a barrier in front of the families as the trucks drove off.

During his trial, Torres told the court he was carrying the shotgun for this own defense. But he then acknowledged lying to police about the gun — and to selling the weapon before he was arrested.

Months after the attack, the ""Respect the Flag"" group was indicted as a street gang by a Douglas County grand jury.

""They recognized that it was not about flying a flag but it was about pointing a shotgun at other people and threatening to kill them because of the color of their skin,"" Fortner said Monday.

Testifying for the victims at Monday's sentencing, Hyesha Bryant, who attended the party, said she forgave the couple.

""I never thought this would be something I'd have to endure in 2017,"" Bryant said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""As adults and parents, we have to instill in our children the values of right and wrong. That moment you had to choose to leave, you stayed.""

""I forgive you. I forgive all of you,"" she said, as Torres and Norton sat weeping. ""I don't have any hate in my heart. Life is too short for that.""

The stiff punishment is being both celebrated and questioned, in a debate that touches on free speech and the nature of terrorism.

Some of those points are summed up in two top-rated responses to the district attorney's Facebook posting that announced the punishment.

One commenter writes:

""To all the people on here saying the punishment was unjust. Let's be real, if it had been any other terrorist group committing these felonies you guys wouldn't bat an eye if they went away for life.... but when the terrorist look like you all of a sudden you get a soft heart.""

But another commenter says:

""Did they actually attack anyone or just guilty of being racists? Not condoning their actions by any means but I'm not sure the punishment fit the crime here. If they attacked the kids or something, let them rot, but just being ignorant racists shouldn't constitute a 20 year sentence. Does that not seem a little extreme?? What am I missing? If everyone in Douglas County that is ignorant and racist (on both sides of the fence) had to serve 20 years, they'd have to build many new jails.""

"Updated at 11:23 a.m. ET

When Donald Trump Jr. met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June at Trump Tower to gather information on Hillary Clinton for his father's presidential campaign, it's now clear there was at least one more Russian in the room. He has been identified in published reports as a Russian-American lobbyist named Rinat Akhmetshin.

Trump Jr. did not mention Akhmetshin in the emails and statements he released about the meeting earlier this week, although one email he received alluded to a second person. It said: ""I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today.""

Akhmetshin has been described as a Russian ""gun for hire"" and a former Soviet-era spy and has worked in the West for years as an advocate for Russian interests.

But in an interview with The Associated Press published Friday morning, Akhmetshin denied having ties to Russian intelligence agencies. He also denied ever serving as a Russian counterintelligence officer, as he has been described in some media reports. ""That is not correct,"" Akhmetshin told The Associated Press. Asked Friday about Akhmetshin, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said, ""We don't know anything about this person,"" The Associated Press also reported.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, named Akhmetshin in a complaint in March about people who are effectively engaged in lobbying work but do not register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Specifically, Akhmetshin has focused on trying to get Congress to repeal restrictions imposed under the Magnitsky Act, intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009, and he has dueled with advocates for the restrictions including financier Bill Browder, as described last year by Radio Free Europe. Browder was among the first to publicly identify Akhmetshin Friday morning after an NBC News report that said that network had learned the identity of a second Russian advocate in the meeting with Trump Jr. and top aides to the Trump campaign.

Akhmetshin was also accused in a 2015 lawsuit with attempting to hack into a mining company's computers.

Along with Trump Jr., at last June's meeting were then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

President Trump has repeatedly defended his son, calling him ""a high quality person"" and saying he ""applaud(s) his transparency."" The president also said the meeting was one ""most people in politics would have taken.""

Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"" when meeting last year with a Kremlin-linked attorney in hopes of gaining damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, President Trump's eldest son explained that he met with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya at the urging of publicist Rob Goldstone because he ""wanted to hear it out"" to see what type of details they had.

""I had been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time, so maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things,"" Trump Jr. said.

Goldstone described the information ""that would incriminate"" Clinton as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" He also described the woman Trump Jr. would later meet as a ""Russian government attorney."" Asked whether any ""sirens"" went off for him, Trump Jr. said, ""Honestly, I don't know."" He added it was ""pre-Russia fever"" and ""pre-Russia mania.""

""So I don't even think my sirens went up, or the antennas went up at this time, because it wasn't the issue that it's been made out to be over the last nine months, 10 months, since it really became a thing,"" Trump Jr. said.

He also characterized the meeting as a ""courtesy"" to Goldstone, a business acquaintance.

""I didn't know if there was any credibility, I didn't know if there was anything behind it, I can't vouch for the information. Someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me. I read it, I responded accordingly,"" Trump Jr. told Hannity.

The president's son posted an email exchange about setting up the June 2016 meeting on Tuesday morning just before The New York Times, which initially broke the story of the meeting over the weekend, was about to publish the emails.

Trump Jr. reiterated that he was willing to cooperate with congressional committees that are investigating Russia and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, and he told Hannity that would include testifying under oath.

""I just want the truth to get out there,"" Trump Jr. said. ""And that's part of why I released all the stuff today, I wanted to get it all out there.""

Ultimately, the meeting — which was also attended by Trump's then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who now serves as a White House senior adviser — was a bust, Trump Jr. said. He added that Kushner left the meeting after about five minutes and Manafort spent most of the meeting on his phone.

""I wouldn't have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff,"" the president's son said. ""It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

Trump Jr. also said he never told his father about the meeting, because ""there was nothing to tell.""

As to whether he has ever held additional meetings with Russians, Trump Jr. said, ""I don't even know, I've probably met with other people from Russia ... not in the context of actual, a formalized meeting or anything like that, because why would I?""

In one of the June 2016 emails to Trump Jr., Goldstone said, ""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

Trump Jr. wrote back, ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.""

Aside from the emails and meeting, Hannity focused much of his program on bashing the mainstream media, inviting Trump Jr. to do so as well.

""They're trying drag out the story, in all fairness,"" the Trump son said. ""They have it, they want to drip a little bit today, drip a little bit then; it's like, here it is. I'm more than happy to be transparent about it, and I'm more than happy to cooperate with everyone.""

As NPR's Peter Overby and Marilyn Geewax note, the situation has put Trump Jr. in legal hot water because there is a federal law that says ""foreign nationals cannot 'directly or indirectly' give a 'thing of value' to American political campaigns. Moreover, the law says no one is allowed to 'solicit, accept, or receive' any thing of value from a foreign national to help a candidate.""

The White House stood behind Trump Jr. on Tuesday as the controversy was unfolding, with White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders reading a statement from the president saying, ""My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency."" Ahead of the Hannity segment airing, Trump promoted the interview on his personal Twitter account, calling his son ""a great person who loves our country!""

This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!

With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!

The morning after former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named special counsel to oversee the investigation into the Trump team ties to Russia, President Trump is declaring ""this"" the ""single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!""

It's another example of Trump going to grievance politics after a week of missteps and revelatory leaks.

On Wednesday, Trump struck a similarly victimized tone while delivering the commencement speech to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.

""Look at the way I've been treated lately, especially by the media,"" he said. ""No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.""

Trump could make his first remarks on the special counsel appointment later Thursday when he meets with the Colombian president at the White House. They are expected to take questions from reporters in the afternoon.

Editor's note: Trump deleted the original tweet because it misspelled ""counsel"" as ""councel."" Once that tweet was deleted, it no longer showed up on our site, so we replaced it with the new one with the corrected spelling.

Former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, saying he believes he was fired because of the Russia investigation he was leading at the time.

The committee posted Comey's opening statement on Wednesday; Comey did not read it aloud during the hearing. In the document, Comey says President Trump asked him for ""loyalty"" at a dinner in January and later in the Oval Office said he ""hope[d] you can let"" the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn ""go."" The White House has denied that Trump ever asked for the investigation to be shut down.

Before Comey was fired on May 9, he led the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and Russia. That probe is now led by a special prosecutor.

"Last summer Felicia Keesing returned from a long trip and found that her home in upstate New York had been subjected to an invasion.

What Causes Pandemics? We Do 

In this series, NPR explores the causes behind our new hyperinfectious era. Join the conversation with the hashtag #KillerViruses or tweet us @NPRGoatsAndSoda 

""There was evidence of mice everywhere. They had completely taken over,"" says Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College.

It was a plague of mice. And it had landed right in Keesing's kitchen.

""Not only were there mouse droppings on our countertops, but we also found dead mice on the kitchen floor,"" says Keesing's husband, Rick Ostfeld, an ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.

The Hudson River Valley experienced a mouse plague during the summer of 2016. The critters were everywhere. For most people, it was just a nuisance. But for Keesing and Ostfeld, the mouse plague signaled something foreboding.

""We're anticipating 2017 to be a particularly risky year for Lyme,"" Ostfeld says.

Keesing and Ostfeld, who have studied Lyme for more than 20 years, have come up with an early warning system for the disease. They can predict how many cases there will be a year in advance by looking at one key measurement: Count the mice the year before.

The number of critters scampering around the forest in the summer correlates to the Lyme cases the following summer, they've reported.

The explanation is simple: Mice are highly efficient transmitters of Lyme. They infect up to 95 percent of ticks that feed on them. Mice are responsible for infecting the majority of ticks carrying Lyme in the Northeast. And ticks love mice. ""An individual mouse might have 50, 60, even 100 ticks covering its ears and face,"" Ostfeld says.

So that mouse plague last year means there is going to be a Lyme plague this year. ""Yep. I'm sorry to say that's the scenario we're expecting,"" Ostfeld says.

He's not exactly sure which parts of the Northeast will be at highest risk.

But wherever Lyme exists, people should be vigilant, says epidemiologist Kiersten Kugeler at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Whether it's a bad season or not, there's still going to be a lot of human cases of tick-borne diseases,"" she says. ""What's important for people to know is that the ticks are spreading to new areas — and tick-borne diseases are coming with them.""

Back in the early '80s, the disease wasn't that big a problem. Cases were confined to two small regions: western Wisconsin and the area from Connecticut to New Jersey.

Since then, Lyme cases have shot up in number and spread in all directions: ""The only place that they haven't really spread is into the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, for obvious reasons,"" says biologist Rebecca Eisen, who's also at the CDC.

Now Lyme is present in more than 260 counties, the CDC reported in 2015. The disease shows up in Maine, swoops down the East Coast into Washington, D.C., and southern Virginia. Then it hops to the Midwest into northern Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. There are also small pockets of Lyme on the West Coast.

Since the early '90s, reported cases of Lyme disease have tripled, to about 30,000 cases each year. The CDC thinks the actual number is 10 times higher.

""We think the true burden of Lyme disease in the U.S. is about 300,000 cases,"" Kugeler says. ""Lyme disease is quite a big public health problem.""

The reasons for this Lyme explosion are many, Ostfeld says. Climate change is part of it. The surge in deer — which feed ticks and spread them around — has also been a factor.

But Ostfeld has found another reason, something that happened more than 200 years ago.

Today the Hudson River Valley in upstate New York is gorgeous. The hills are covered with oak forests, and the valleys are patchworks of hayfields and farms.

But Ostfeld says the area didn't always look like this. When the Europeans came here hundreds of years ago, they clear-cut nearly all of the forests to plant crops and raise livestock.

""They also cut down trees for commercial use,"" Ostfeld says, ""to make masts for ships, and for firewood.""

Since then a lot of the forest has come back — but it's not the same forest as before, he says. Today it's all broken up into little pieces, with roads, farms and housing developments.

For mice, this has been great news.

""They tend to thrive in these degraded, fragmented landscapes,"" Ostfeld says, because their predators need big forests to survive.

Without as many foxes, hawks and owls to eat them, mice crank out babies. And we end up with forests packed with mice — mice that are chronically infected with Lyme and covered with ticks.

So all these little patches of forest dotting the Northeast have basically turned into Lyme factories, spilling over with infected ticks.

Then people come along and do the darndest thing, Keesing says: They build their dream homes right next door. ""So we see that humans are putting themselves in these areas where they're most at risk,"" she says.

And that means people, in some areas, may be putting themselves at risk for Lyme every single day without even knowing it, says the CDC's Kiersten Kugeler. ""In the Northeast, most people catch Lyme around their homes,"" she says. ""People out gardening. People playing in their backyard. Mowing the lawn.""

So what can you do to keep from getting infected? Add a tick check to your daily routine, Kugeler says. When you're in the shower check your body for tiny ticks, especially the places they like to hide.

""That's the scalp, behind the ears, the armpits and in the groin area,"" she says.

If you do find a tick, get it off as quickly as possible. The longer an infected tick stays on your skin, the greater the chance it will pass the Lyme bacteria on to you. Generally, it takes about 24 hours for the tick to infect a person after it starts biting.

Then be on the lookout for Lyme symptoms — like a red rash or a fever. It anything crops up, go see a doctor immediately. Don't wait: The earlier you get treated, the better chance you'll have for a full recovery.

Chris Cornell, the unmistakable voice and frontman of the bands Soundgarden and Audioslave, died overnight in Detroit at the age of 52. He was discovered just past midnight at the MGM Grand Detroit, according to police.

The office of the Wayne County Medical Examiner on Thursday determined the cause of his death to be suicide by hanging, noting that a full autopsy has yet to be completed.

""His wife Vicky and family were shocked to learn of his sudden and unexpected passing, and they will be working closely with the medical examiner to determine the cause,"" Brian Bumbery, Cornell's representative, says in a statement. ""They would like to thank his fans for their continuous love and loyalty and ask that their privacy be respected at this time.""

Cornell played a seminal role in the origins of grunge music, founding Soundgarden in 1984 with Kim Thayil and Hiro Yamamoto. Together with other Seattle natives Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, the band — and Cornell's voice — would go on to define a sound that cherry-picked elements of punk and metal and distorted them into a distinctive brew all their own.

At Soundgarden's peak of popularity in the mid-1990s, the band's album Superunknown earned a Billboard No. 1 debut and a Grammy nomination for best rock record.

After the band broke up in 1997, Cornell pursued a solo career — though only for a few years. By 2001, he had helped found the supergroup Audioslave with several members of Rage Against the Machine.

Audioslave released three albums before disbanding in 2007, as well.

In 2012, Soundgarden returned with its first studio album in about a decade and a half — a fact NPR's Rachel Martin mentioned in a 2015 interview with Cornell, shortly after he had just released a new solo album.

Rachel asked him: Do you need both the band and the solo work to make you whole as an artist?

""I would live without both parts. But it's a lot more satisfying to have them. It's great to still be having new experiences with the same group of guys — because we invented a band together, and kind of co-invented a genre of music. Being able to come back and experience being a band together at a different time in our lives has been really rewarding, but it's also just really nice to still share some part of my life with these people that have been so important to it.' ""

Cornell had been on tour in Detroit at the time of his death.

President Trump said he would invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the White House ""at the right time"" when asked by a reporter on Air Force One Wednesday night.

""I don't think this is the right time, but the answer is yes I would,"" he said, according to a pool report released on Thursday. ""Look, it's very easy for me to say absolutely, I won't. That's the easy thing for me to do, but that's the stupid thing to do.""

Trump also continued to be evasive about whether he believes Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf.

""I'm not saying it wasn't Russia,"" Trump said. ""What I'm saying is that we have to protect ourselves no matter who it is. You know, China is very good at this. I hate to say it, North Korea is very good at this.""

The comments follow a major development in the Russia-election saga this week, with revelations that Donald Trump Jr. met with a person in 2016 who he was told was working on behalf of the Russian government to help Trump's campaign.

President Trump defended the meeting again on Thursday. ""Honestly, in a world of politics, most people are going to take that meeting,"" he said, reiterating comments he made on Wednesday to Reuters and in Paris on Thursday during a joint press conference with the French president.

Amid ongoing investigations into Russian meddling and potential ties to the Trump campaign, Trump maintained, ""There's no collusion, there's no obstruction, there's no nothing. Honestly, the whole thing, it is really a media witch hunt.""

Trump has equivocated on Russia's role in the election, even contradicting his own intelligence chiefs. Though he says he pressed Putin on meddling during their meeting at the Group of 20 economic forum in Germany on July 7.

He told reporters on Thursday that he couldn't believe that Putin would have favored him over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, as the intelligence community has concluded.

""So, the next time I'm with Putin, I'm going to ask him: Who were you really for? Because I can't believe that he would have been for me. Me. Strong military, strong borders — but he cares less about the borders — but strong military, tremendous,"" he said.

In the conversation with reporters, which lasted about an hour, the president also discussed health care, border security and trade.

Health care, Trump noted the night before Senate Republicans released an updated revision of their bill, is ""the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians.""

The amended Senate proposal includes provisions to appease both moderate and conservative Republicans who had concerns, but the legislation's future is still uncertain with two senators expressing their intention to vote against letting the bill move forward. That is all Senate leadership can lose to still pass the bill.

As Trump told reporters Wednesday, ""You get a couple here and you say, great, and then you find out you just lost four over here. Health care is tough.""

On the border wall, Trump said, ""There is a very good chance we can do a solar wall"" at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump described such a wall in June: ""It creates energy, and pays for itself. And this way Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good.""

On Wednesday, the president added, ""One of the things with the wall is you need transparency. You have to be able to see through it. ... As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don't see them — they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over.""

As part of his ongoing promise to renegotiate what he has called unfair trade deals, Trump has pushed recently to revisit steel imports. He said Wednesday he is considering ""quotas and tariffs. Maybe I'll do both.""

The Commerce Department has been reviewing steel and aluminum imports, but restricting those imports would be controversial among steel consumers in the U.S. and with trade partners.

In her most frank remarks to date after her loss to President Trump, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said that if not for a controversial letter from FBI Director James Comey and Russian meddling in the election, she would be sitting in the Oval Office right now.

Clinton told CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour during an interview at a Women for Women International luncheon Tuesday that she did take personal responsibility for her loss, because, ultimately, it was her name on the ballot. But she pointed to those key events that she said changed the trajectory of the race.

""I've been in a lot of campaigns and I'm very proud of the campaign I ran,"" the former secretary of state said. ""It wasn't a perfect campaign — there's no such thing — but I was on the way to winning until a few things happened.""

""If the election was on Oct. 27, I'd be your president,"" Clinton continued, pointing to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver showing that Comey's Oct. 28 announcement that the FBI was reopening the investigation into her private email server impacted her chances.

She also noted that within hours of the release of a damaging 2005 Access Hollywood tape of Trump making vulgar remarks about women, WikiLeaks had released emails from her campaign chief, John Podesta, intended to damage her and turn the focus off her opponent.

""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] certainly interfered in our election, and it was designed to hurt me and help my opponent,"" Clinton said. ""And the opposing campaign took advantage of that as well.""

""Did we make mistakes? Yes,"" Clinton said, teasing that she'd have much more to say about that in her upcoming memoir this fall. ""The reason I believe we lost was because of events of the last 10 days.""

And multiple times throughout the interview, she twisted the knife a bit more, noting that, ""I did win 3 million more votes than my opponent"" in the popular vote.

It was needling that seemed destined to eventually draw a pointed response from the president on Twitter, Amanpour noted, and Clinton said she was fine with that.

""Better that than interfering in foreign affairs"" with his 140-character missives, she quipped.

Hours later, Trump would take that bait and responded on Twitter.

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?

Clinton also acknowledged that misogyny did play a role in her loss and that she would elaborate on that in her book as well.

""I think it would have been a really big deal"" to elect the first female president, Clinton said.

She criticized the media for not pushing Trump more for specifics on how he would keep his sweeping list of promises, including creating jobs. But she wouldn't apologize for her wonkiness and love of policy detail, even if that made it hard for her to connect with some voters.

""I can't be anything other than who I am,"" Clinton said.

She wasn't entirely dismissive of President Trump, though, revealing that she did support his decision last month to launch a missile strike in Syria after the country's president, Bashar Assad, used chemical weapons against his own people.

However, Clinton said she was ""not convinced [the strike] really made much of a difference"" and was concerned about possible backroom deals the Trump administration may have made with Russia, notifying Moscow beforehand of the strikes against their ally.

The former secretary of state also criticized cuts that Trump proposed for the State Department and foreign aid, noting that even his secretary of defense, James Mattis, said that strategy was unwise.

While Clinton didn't talk much about what she might do next — other than focusing on her memoirs — she did hint she wasn't through yet speaking out against the man who beat her last year.

""I'm back to being a private citizen — and part of the resistance,"" Clinton said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants 2018 to be a year of bipartisanship, even if that means moving on from GOP dreams of cutting welfare and fully rolling back the Affordable Care Act.

The Kentucky Republican on Thursday broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In an interview with NPR, McConnell said he is ""not interested"" in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats.

""I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,"" McConnell said. ""The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it.""

McConnell said he wants to spend much of next year focused on issues on which Republicans can work with at least some Democrats in the Senate.

""This has not been a very bipartisan year,"" McConnell said. ""I hope in the new year, we're going to pivot here and become more cooperative.""

Republicans spent most of the year struggling, and failing, to follow through on promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Democrats refused to work with Republicans while they were trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement, and McConnell hopes that next year will be different.

""Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,"" McConnell said. ""We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.""

McConnell is referring to the political reality that the odds for legislation with only GOP support become longer in January when Sen.-elect Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, takes office.

Republican demands to gut the ACA also declined after Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by zeroing out the tax penalty in Obamacare as part of the tax bill approved this week. McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.

""I think the repeal of the individual mandate takes the heart out of Obamacare,"" McConnell said. ""We want to steady the insurance markets if we can ... and I think we'll probably be addressing that part of health care sometime next year.""

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina immediately pushed back on McConnell's comments. ""To those who believe — including Senate Republican leadership — that in 2018 there will not be another effort to Repeal and Replace Obamacare — you are sadly mistaken,"" Graham said in a statement and on Twitter.

I’m fully committed to Repealing and Replacing Obamacare in 2018 by block-granting the money back to the states and away from Washington bureaucrats who are completely unaccountable to the patients of America.

After the major push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act over the summer, Graham joined with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to promote a bill that would deconstruct the programs that make up the ACA and hand the funds over to the states to run their own programs. It would have gotten rid of the law's subsidies that help low-income consumers purchase insurance and the expansion of Medicaid that it allowed.

McConnell also plans to spend much of the year persuading skeptical voters to embrace the GOP tax overhaul. Recent polls have shown that a majority of voters expect to pay more under the tax bill, a perception McConnell hopes to disprove in the coming months.

""I do think the coverage has been overwhelmingly negative, and it certainly has an impact on it,"" McConnell said. ""You take a family of four making $73,000 a year [that] will save about $2000. Now, to lot of people inside the Beltway that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but to that family, that's a 58 percent reduction in their tax bill.""

McConnell also expects bipartisan work will continue in the Senate probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. McConnell said he hopes the investigation will conclude in time to give voters confidence in the security of the elections process ahead of the midterm election in November.

""I'm looking forward to a recommendation from them, and I'm hoping that it will be a bipartisan recommendation,"" McConnell said. ""Because if it breaks into pure partisanship, no one's going to pay any attention to it.""

He also rejected the notion that President Trump is preparing to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. ""The only people that talk about that are the Democrats,"" McConnell said. ""But I don't hear anybody at the White House or any Republicans, and certainly not in the Senate, calling for Mueller to be fired.""

"Updated: 7:26 p.m.

The House overwhelmingly passed a sanctions bill on Tuesday that would punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election and tie President Trump's hands in terms of lifting economic restrictions on Moscow.

The bill would also impose sanctions on North Korea and Iran for their respective weapons programs.

The vote was lopsided: 419-3.

""There's been a lot of doubt about whether this Congress would ever speak eloquently and forcefully about Russian behavior — today we answered that question,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., on the House floor before the vote.

""Overwhelmingly, we say Russia's behavior is unacceptable in many, many ways.""

The bill's supporters say that includes the election interference described by the American intelligence community — but still sometimes questioned by Trump — as well as Russia's annexation of Crimea and sponsorship of warfare in Eastern Ukraine.

The legislation slaps Moscow with new financial restrictions on doing business with American entities while also restricting Trump's ability to waive those penalties. Often, a president has a freer hand in dealing with foreign governments, but the bill deliberately takes away that discretion.

To waive sanctions on Russia, Trump would have to send Congress a report explaining and justifying his decision, and lawmakers would then get 30 days to decide whether to allow it.

The vote puts Trump in an awkward position. He raised eyebrows from his first days on the campaign trail by expressing a desire to improve the U.S.- Russia relationship. He and his staff have specifically expressed an openness to easing sanctions.

""I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only, is possible, absolutely possible,"" Trump said last year at a campaign speech in Washington.

Trump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin twice earlier this month while in Hamburg, Germany, for the Group of 20 summit, including a chat that went longer than two hours.

Administration officials had previously signaled that Trump would sign the sanctions bill — it appears to have a veto-proof majority in both houses of Congress — but press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement Tuesday that said it might depend on the details.

""While the president supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President's desk,"" she said.

The bill now moves to the Senate, but it's unclear when the upper chamber will take it up.

"Updated at 3:38 p.m. ET

Former CIA Director John Brennan told the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday that Russia ""brazenly interfered in the 2016 election process,"" despite U.S. efforts to warn it off. Brennan testified in an open session of the committee, one of a handful of congressional committees now investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Brennan said he told his Russian counterpart, the head of Russia's FSB, last August that if Russia pursued its efforts to interfere, ""it would destroy any near-term prospect for improvement in relations"" between the two countries. He said Russia denied any attempts to interfere.

In his opening statement, Brennan also recounted how he had briefed congressional leaders in August of last year, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the ""full details"" of what he knew of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Brennan said he became convinced last summer that Russia was trying to interfere in the campaign, saying ""they were very aggressive.""

Brennan said he is ""aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign."" Brennan said that concerned him, ""because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals,"" and that it raised questions about whether or not the Russians ""were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals."" Brennan added he didn't know if ""collusion existed"" between the Russians and those he identified as involved in the Trump campaign.

While Brennan would not specifically identify any individuals associated with the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russian officials and would not opine as to whether there was any collusion or collaboration, he did tell lawmakers why he was concerned about the contacts occurring against the general background of Russian efforts to meddle in the election. Brennan said he's studied Russian intelligence activities over the years, and how Russian intelligence services have been able to get people to betray their country. ""Frequently, individuals on a treasonous path do not even realize they're on that path until it gets to be too late,"" he said.

Brennan said Russia was motivated to back Donald Trump in the presidential election because of a ""traditional animus"" between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He told committee members there had not been a good relationship between Putin and the Clintons over the years. What's more, Brennan said Putin blamed Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state during the Obama administration for domestic disturbances inside Russia. He said Putin was concerned Clinton would be more ""rigid"" on issues such as human rights if elected president.

But Brennan told the committee he believed that Russia anticipated that Clinton would be the likely winner of the presidential race, and that Russia tried to ""damage and bloody"" her before Election Day. Had she won, Brennan said, Russia would have continued to attempt to ""denigrate her and hurt her"" during her presidency. If Russia had collected more information about Clinton that they did not use against her during the campaign, Brennan said they were likely ""husbanding it for another day.""

On another question, Brennan criticized President Trump's reported sharing of classified intelligence with Russia officials. Brennan said if reports were accurate, Trump violated ""protocols"" by sharing the information with Russia's foreign minister and ambassador to the U.S.

Brennan also said he was ""very concerned"" by the release of what he said appears to be classified information from the Trump administration. He said there appear to be ""very, very damaging leaks, and I find them appalling and they need to be tracked down.""

Reacting to Brennan's testimony, a White House spokesman said ""This morning's hearings back up what we've been saying all along: that despite a year of investigation, there is still no evidence of any Russia-Trump campaign collusion, that the President never jeopardized intelligence sources or sharing, and that even Obama's CIA Director believes the leaks of classified information are 'appalling' and the culprits must be 'tracked down.'""

Under questioning from Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., Brennan said the Russians have been trying to disrupt Western elections since the 1960s, and that they've quickly adapted to the times. Brennan pointed to the ease with which Russia was able to hack Democratic operatives' emails, which were then published on WikiLeaks.

""The cyber-environment now really provides so much more opportunity for troublemaking and the Russians take advantage of it,"" he said. Brennan said the use of spear phishing, and ""whatever else so that they can then gain access to people's emails, computer systems networks,"" is something that the Russians are adept at.

He said Russia used WikiLeaks as a ""cut-out,"" or go-between, and that protests by WikiLeaks that it is not working with Russia and Russia's claims it is not working with WikiLeaks are ""disingenuous.""

Brennan led the CIA during the Obama administration from 2013-2017. Prior to that, Brennan was a top counterterrorism and homeland security adviser to President Barack Obama.

Tuesday's public hearing represented an effort by the House Intelligence Committee to get its Russia investigation back on track after political squabbling and concerns about information-sharing between its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and White House aides sidelined the committee's work. After pressure from Democrats, Nunes has turned over leading the committee's Russia investigation to Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who is also a CPA.

Following Brennan's public testimony Tuesday morning, he will testify in a closed-door session. His testimony comes a day after former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn refused to hand over documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, in response to a congressional subpoena from that committee. Flynn cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

"European authorities are providing new details about a cloud of mysterious radioactive material that appeared over the continent last month.

Monitors in Italy were among first to detect the radioactive isotope ruthenium-106 on Oct. 3, according to a fresh report by France's Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute, known as IRSN. In total, 28 European countries saw the radioactive cloud, the report says.

The multinational Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation, which runs a network designed to monitor for nuclear weapons tests, also confirmed to NPR that it had detected the cloud.

Based on the detection from monitoring stations and meteorological data, the mysterious cloud — which has since dissipated — has been traced to somewhere along the Russia-Kazakhstan border, according to Jean-Christophe Gariel, director for health at the IRSN.

""It's somewhere in South Russia,"" he says, likely between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains.

Authorities say the amount of material seen in Europe was small. ""It's a very low level of radioactivity and it poses no problems for health and the environment in Europe,"" Gariel says.

But modeling suggests that any people within a few kilometers of the release — wherever it occurred — would have needed to seek shelter to protect themselves from possible radiation exposure.

""If it would have happened in France, we would have taken measures to protect the population in a radius of a few kilometers,"" Gariel says. French authorities, he adds, will conduct random checks of foodstuffs from the region to check for possible contamination of agricultural products.

Ruthenium-106 is a radioactive isotope that is not found in nature. ""It's an unusual isotope,"" says Anders Ringbom, the research director of the Swedish Defence Research Agency, which runs radioactive monitoring for that nation. ""I don't think we have seen it since the Chernobyl accident.""

The IRSN analysis suggests that the ruthenium did not come from a nuclear reactor accident. Instead, it most likely came from either the chemical reprocessing of old nuclear fuel or the production of isotopes used in medicine. Based on the size of the release, Gariel says, whatever happened had to have been accidental.

""It's not an authorized release, we are sure about that,"" he says.

A handful of Russian nuclear facilities are located roughly in the region where the ruthenium originated, including a large nuclear reprocessing plant known as the Mayak Production Association.

During the Cold War, the Mayak plant turned used nuclear fuel into material for nuclear weapons. The plant has been the site of numerous past accidents, including a 1957 explosion that rivaled the nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima and Chernobyl.

Gariel says that while Mayak is a possible source of the cloud, there simply aren't enough data to conclusively link it to the release of radioactive material. He also says he has spoken to Russian safety officials over the past few days and that while they do not dispute his analysis, they are unaware of any incidents in the region in the past few months.

"Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET

Apparent Russian agents began reaching out to Donald Trump's presidential campaign as early as March 2016, the Justice Department established in documents released Monday, with appeals for partnership and offers of help including ""dirt"" on Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton.

That case is made in charging documents in the case of then-Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

The court documents got a little less focus early in the day than other indictments involving Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a top aide, Rick Gates, who was Manafort's deputy and a business partner. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to all the charges announced earlier Monday, NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports. The two men were deemed a flight risk and put under house arrest.

But the Papadopoulos matter speaks to the heart of the mandate for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller — to examine potential connections between people in the Trump campaign and Russian influencemongers.

What is now known is that Russia tried to infiltrate the Trump campaign — and did so successfully, at least at some level. Put in context of other reporting around the Russia story, it is a remarkable establishment.

The court documents also establish that Russia promised ""thousands of emails"" that would have ""dirt"" on Clinton to Papadopoulos in April 2016. A trove of hacked Democratic emails was released by WikiLeaks three months later — in the midst of the Democratic National Convention.

""I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said, appearing to encourage Russia to continue digging. His campaign denied he was doing that. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""

Papadopoulos tried to set up additional meetings or contacts between people in the Trump campaign and Russians. There were many contacts, according to the court documents, which describe meetings or messages between Papadopoulos and at least two Russians, a ""professor"" in London and a woman.

But what remains unknown is: Who are the high-ranking campaign officials Papadopoulos contacted and what did those other officials do, if anything, with information Papadopoulos shared?

It is known, however, that Donald Trump Jr., the son of the billionaire, organized and took a meeting with Russian nationals, who also promised dirt on Clinton.

""If it's what you say,"" Trump Jr. wrote to the associate who set up the meeting, ""I love it.""

Manafort and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a key adviser, also attended the meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016.

This is the first time a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 election has been established by an ironclad official government source. Reporting that has linked the Trump campaign and Russia's effort has been dismissed by the White House and the president as ""fake news.""

Shortly after the charges against Manafort and Gates were announced, President Trump dismissed their significance.

Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????

....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!

Papadopoulos' guilty plea is going to be more difficult for him to downplay, although the White House tried to do so on Monday.

""Today's announcement has nothing to do with the president or the campaign or campaign activity,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a White House press briefing.

Of course, that is not true. Trump named Papadopoulos as a foreign-policy adviser to the campaign. Sanders, however, dismissed him as merely a ""volunteer member of an advisory council that met one time.""

Sanders tried to turn attention to the Clinton campaign instead, alleging it ""colluded"" with Russian intelligence to craft the so-called Steele Dossier. The dossier, which collected opposition research on Trump that eventually focused on his ties to Russia, was initially paid for by the conservative Washington Free Beacon website. The site is funded in large part by conservative donor Paul Singer, who was a Trump skeptic and backed Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for president.

Research for the dossier was conducted by a firm called Fusion GPS, run by two former investigative reporters. They hired Chris Steele, a former British spy turned private investigator. Steele has ties to U.S. intelligence and is known as a Russia expert; he was hired to find more information about Trump's ties in Russia that they couldn't get.

When the primaries were over, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee picked up the tab to keep the research going.

Sanders called the dossier ""false information."" Some of it has been confirmed by news outlets. Some of it is incendiary and has not been independently confirmed. Sanders dismissed the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr. and Russian nationals as simply ""a meeting that took place"" and ""routine.""

It was not routine. Opposition research is, but not seeking it from foreign governments.

Sanders, though, contended the Clinton campaign's and DNC's ""millions of dollars"" paid for the oppo-research file (that it never used) was far worse that Trump Jr.'s meeting — or anything coming out of Monday's court documents.

""They took one meeting, and nothing came of it,"" she said.

Sanders also said the president had ""no reaction,"" because ""it doesn't have anything to do with us.""

Not the end of the Mueller investigation

There could be more details to come either from Mueller or the congressional committees that are investigating the Russia imbroglio. Court documents indicate that Papadopoulos has met with the government ""on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.""

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russia-Trump ties, in a statement called Monday's developments ""a significant and sobering step in what will be a complex and likely lengthy investigation by the Special Counsel. That is why it is imperative that Congress take action now to protect the independence of the Special Counsel, wherever or however high his investigation may lead.""

His office also said he wants bipartisan members of Congress to ""make clear"" to President Trump ""that issuing pardons to any of his associates or to himself would be unacceptable, and result in immediate, bipartisan action by Congress.""

The president has the unfettered ability to pardon anyone for federal crimes. But that applies only to federal crimes. Some officials, including Manafort, could also face charges at the state level — in New York, for example.

Warner also put the guilty plea and indictments in the context of broader developments on the Trump-Russia investigation over the past several months.

""This is just the latest in a series of undisclosed contacts, misleading public statements, potentially compromising information, and highly questionable actions from the time of the Trump campaign that together, remain a cause for deep concern and continued investigation,"" he said.

And there are indications that Papadopoulos is cooperating with federal agents.

""It is in the best interest of our client, George Papadopoulos, that we refrain from commenting on George's case,"" his lawyers, Thomas M. Breen and Robert W. Stanley, said in a short statement obtained by NPR's Carrie Johnson.

They then added: ""We will have the opportunity to comment on George's involvement when called upon by the Court at a later date. We look forward to telling all of the details of George's story at that time.""

Trump and other conservatives have tried to sully Mueller's name, hoping to delegitimize his findings as politically motivated. One Mueller ally, fired former FBI Director James Comey, took to his newly revealed Twitter account to seemingly — and cryptically — back up the special counsel:

“Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man’s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.” Reinhold Niebuhr

The charges

Manafort and Gates were charged with ""conspiracy against the United States,"" ""conspiracy to launder money"" and other offenses. The two were expected in court in Washington by the afternoon.

The Justice Department indictment on Manafort and Gates contains 12 counts: ""conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.""

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI.

The Manafort and Gates indictment unsealed on Monday morning does not make any reference to Russia's influence campaign against the presidential election, but it does allege extensive financial ties between Manafort and Gates and powerful Ukrainians.

The Papadopoulos materials, on the other hand, detail the many contacts investigators say he had with Russian-linked operatives. He met at least two people, a man and a woman, who the FBI says were working for the Russian government and had boasted to him about the help it could offer the Trump campaign against Clinton.

Manafort and Gates turned themselves in to the FBI on Monday morning. Papadopoulos' status was unclear.

Manafort appeared at the FBI's Washington field office just after 8 a.m. with his lawyer, Kevin Downing. Manafort was escorted into the building by an FBI agent.

Appearing after his client's plea, however, Downing sounded like his client and the Trump campaign were one and the same.

""Well, I think you all saw today that President Donald Trump was correct — there is no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government,"" Downing said outside federal court, per NPR's Miles Parks.

He contended that Manafort was merely representing ""pro-European Union campaigns for the Ukrainian ..."" He added that ""he was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukraine come closer to the United States and the EU."" He then pointed out that his client's work in Ukraine ended in 2014, ""over two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign.""

He said the indictment was being brought ""using a very novel theory,"" regarding a federal filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He noted that FARA has been used only half a dozen times in the last 50 years and with only one conviction. He's right that the act is seldom used.

Downing then thundered, ""The second thing about this indictment that I myself find most ridiculous is the claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal from the United States government is ridiculous.""

A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment to NPR.

The Ukraine connection

Manafort headed Trump's campaign from June to August 2016. He stepped down after reports emerged about his business relationship with pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine, allegedly replete with millions of dollars in cash payments and undisclosed lobbying efforts.

The indictment released on Monday charges Manafort and Gates with the extensive use of offshore bank accounts, through which flowed more than $75 million. The document alleges that Manafort laundered more than $18 million of that to conceal it from U.S. authorities and that Gates transferred more than $3 million.

Manafort grew wealthy over a colorful career in his four decades as a Republican operative and lobbyist.

He worked for Republican campaigns in the late 1970s and early 1980s before moving into the lucrative world of international lobbying, where he teamed up with Roger Stone to found the firm Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly.

Manafort represented a host of unsavory characters over the years, including Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and Zaire's leader Mobutu Sese Seko.

In the early 2000s, Manafort headed to Ukraine to work as an adviser to the pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych, helping him win the presidency in 2010. Yanukovych was overthrown by a wave of popular protests four years later. He fled to Russia.

Manafort later became an early backer of Trump, eventually assuming the role of chairman of his insurgent presidential campaign. Trump and the White House have lately downplayed Manafort's role in the 2016 operation. But at the time, their relationship was said to be close.

Manafort is ""the one person in the room that calls him 'Donald,' "" as Republican operative Scott Reed told NPR last year. ""It's not 'Mr. Trump.' It's 'Donald.' 'Come on, Donald; we've got to do the right thing here.""

A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to a request for comment.

The National Sleep Foundation recommends an average of eight hours of sleep per night for adults, but sleep scientist Matthew Walker says that too many people are falling short of the mark.

""Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent gain,"" Walker says. ""Many people walk through their lives in an underslept state, not realizing it.""

Walker is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He points out that lack of sleep — defined as six hours or fewer — can have serious consequences. Sleep deficiency is associated with problems in concentration, memory and the immune system, and may even shorten life span.

""Every disease that is killing us in developed nations has causal and significant links to a lack of sleep,"" he says. ""So that classic maxim that you may [have] heard that you can sleep when you're dead, it's actually mortally unwise advice from a very serious standpoint.""

Walker discusses the importance of sleep — and offers strategies for getting the recommended eight hours — in his new book, Why We Sleep.

Interview Highlights

On what you should do if you can't sleep

You should not actually stay in bed for very long awake, because your brain is this remarkably associative device and it quickly learns that the bed is about being awake. So you should go to another room — a room that's dim. Just read a book — no screens, no phones — and only when you're sleepy return to the bed. And that way your brain relearns the association with your bedroom being about sleep rather than wakefulness. ...

Another thing that people can do if you don't want to get up and go to a different room is actually try meditating. ... Being quite a stoic, hard-nosed scientist, I actually didn't really believe the data [about meditation as a sleep aid], even though the data is very strong. And I started doing it myself, particularly when I was traveling with jet lag, and I found it to be very effective. ...

Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams

Hardcover, 360 pages |

It just quiets the mind and it dampens down what we call the ""fight or flight"" branch of the nervous system, which is one of the key features of insomnia. And that can really have some efficacious benefits too. So that's another solution if people would choose not to go to a different room.

On whether you can make up for a sleep deficit by sleeping longer another day

You're trying to sleep off a debt that you've lumbered your brain and body with during the week, and wouldn't it be lovely if sleep worked like that? Sadly it doesn't. Sleep is not like the bank, so you can't accumulate a debt and then try and pay it off at a later point in time. And the reason is this: We know that if I were to deprive you of sleep for an entire night — take away eight hours — and then in the subsequent night I give you all of the sleep that you want, however much you wish to consume, you never get back all that you lost. You will sleep longer, but you will never achieve that full eight-hour repayment, as it were. So the brain has no capacity to get back that lost sleep that you've been lumbering it with during the week in terms of a debt.

On letting teenagers sleep on weekends

Parents will often pull the covers off their teenager [on] weekends and say, ""It's daylight out! It's noon! You're wasting the day!"" And that's wrong for two reasons. ... It's not their fault; it's their biology that wants them to be asleep at that time. But it's more than that, because it also turns out that they are trying to sleep off a debt that we have actually saddled them with by way of this incessant model of early school start times. We have to abandon that attitude and we also have to change the educational practice as well.

On how the quantity and quality of sleep decreases with age 

The amount of sleep — the total amount of sleep that you get — starts to decrease the older that we get. I think one of the myths out there is that we simply need less sleep as we age, and that's not true, in fact. We need just as much sleep in our 60s, 70s [and] 80s, as we do when we're in our 40s. It's simply that the brain is not capable of generating that sleep, which it still needs, and the body still needs. So, total amount of sleep actually decreases.

We also know that the continuity of sleep also starts to fall apart. Sleep becomes much more fragmented. There are many more awakenings throughout the night — pain, bathroom trips, etc. But we also know that it's not the quantity of sleep that changes with aging, it's also the quality of sleep.

It seems to be particularly the deepest stage of sleep — something that we call non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, or non-REM sleep, the very deepest stages of non-REM sleep — those are selectively eroded by the aging process. By the time you're in your 50s, you've perhaps lost almost 40 to 50 percent of that deep sleep you were having, for example, when you were a teenager. By age 70, you may have lost almost 90 percent of that deep sleep.

On using sleeping pills, like Ambien, to sleep 

Unfortunately the current set or classes of sleeping pills that we have do not produce naturalistic sleep. So they are all a broad set of chemicals that we call the sedative hypnotics, and sedation is not sleep, it's very different. It doesn't give you the restorative natural benefits of sleep. ... If you look at the electrical signature of sleep that you have when you're taking those medications, it's not the same as a normal night of sleep.

On how caffeine affects sleep 

First, and most obvious for some people, is that it stops you falling asleep. Some people, however, say, ""I can have a cup of coffee after dinner and I fall asleep just fine, so I'm not one of those people that is sensitive to caffeine."" And that's quite dangerous, because we also know that even if you can fall asleep, the depth of the sleep that you have when caffeine is swilling around within the brain is not going to be as deep anymore.

So people may wake up the next morning, they'll feel unrefreshed. They'll start to reach for the coffeepot earlier. They'll drink more caffeine, never having realized that it was the cup of coffee last night that has left you feeling underslept, because they didn't wake up during the night, they didn't have problems falling asleep, but caffeine can still have that deleterious impact.

On alcohol's effect on sleep 

Alcohol ... is a sedative drug, and what you're doing there is simply knocking yourself out. You are removing consciousness quickly from the brain by way of having alcohol, but you're not putting yourself into naturalistic sleep. The other issue is that alcohol will fragment your sleep — it will litter it and punctuate it with many more awakenings throughout the night, so short ... that you tend not to remember them. So, once again, you're not quite aware of how bad your sleep was when you had alcohol in the system. The final aspect of alcohol is that it is very good at blocking your REM sleep, or your dream sleep, which is critical for aspects of mental health within the brain and emotional restitution too. So alcohol [is a] very misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep — not helpful.

"The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Russian Olympic Committee ""with immediate effect,"" essentially banning the country from the upcoming Winter Olympics over Russia's system of state-supported cheating by athletes using performance-enhancing drugs.

Russian athletes can compete in the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the IOC said Tuesday — but the athletes will have to pass strict scrutiny, and instead of wearing their nation's uniform, they will compete under the title ""Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR).""

""They will compete with a uniform bearing this name and under the Olympic Flag,"" the IOC said. ""The Olympic Anthem will be played in any ceremony.""

Press Conference with IOC President Thomas Bach #IOCEB https://t.co/jBUDC6mToe

IOC President Thomas Bach and other members of the Olympic governing body pronounced Russia's fate at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. You can watch it on YouTube.

Bach called Russia's concerted attempts to break the rules ""an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport,"" citing the manipulation of the anti-doping lab at the Sochi Olympics of 2014.

""As an athlete myself, I'm feeling very sorry for all the clean athletes,"" Bach said.

As it announced Russia's punishment, the IOC also released the latest report by the disciplinary commission chaired by Samuel Schmid, a former president of Switzerland. The IOC's executive board banned Russia based on the Schmid commission's findings of institutionalized cheating.

While the Schmid report criticizes Russia's minister of sport and describes ""a widespread culture of doping in Russia,"" it also states that it didn't find any solid evidence ""confirming the support of the knowledge of this system by the highest State authority"" — seemingly a reference to President Vladimir Putin.

Of the growing number of athletes who have been stripped of their medals, Bach said the IOC is looking at how to give clean athletes who are elevated to the podium the recognition they deserve months and years after they competed.

""No official of the Russian Ministry of Sport will be accredited for the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018,"" Bach said. He added that the ministry's former head, Vitaly Mutko, is barred for life from any Olympic Games.

Mutko was Russia's minister of sport from 2008 to 2016; after he left that post, Putin appointed him deputy prime minister.

Bach also said the Russian Olympic Committee must pay a total of $15 million to pay for the IOC's doping investigation and to contribute money to the Independent Testing Authority ""to build the capacity and the integrity of the global anti-doping system.""

Reacting to the IOC's moves Tuesday, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said, ""The IOC took a strong and principled decision. There were no perfect options, but this decision will clearly make it less likely that this ever happens again. Now it is time to look ahead to Pyeongchang.""

The decision by the IOC's executive board follows last year's McLaren report from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which confirmed that Russia's Olympics program had engaged in an ""institutional conspiracy"" to beat the system that included using a ""mouse hole"" through which to swap out athletes' drug-tainted samples for clean ones. The investigation was led by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren.

Russian officials have refused to acknowledge the scope and depth of the findings about the country's Olympic teams, saying that the problems were limited to individual athletes. Putin has called the doping charges against Russia ""a dangerous return to this policy of letting politics interfere with sport.""

Released in two phases, the McLaren report concluded that Russia's scheme involved more than 1,000 Russian athletes and that it also included plans both for manipulating doping controls and for covering up the system.

Ahead of the IOC's decision, NPR's Lucian Kim visited Moscow's famous Gorky Park to hear what Russians are making of the claims against their country in some of its most revered sports.

Speaking to Yekaterina Nogerova, whose 6-year-old daughter was skating out on the ice, Lucian says that she says a decision against Russia would be a ""catastrophe"" for her. Nogerova also said she is upset that the consequences will likely punish athletes and fans, but not people in the government.

In releasing the McLaren report, WADA recommended that the IOC ban all Russian athletes and government officials from the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro. Both McLaren and WADA acknowledged that they lack the authority to punish Russia's athletes.

Instead of issuing a blanket ban on Russia from competing in Rio, the IOC left it to the individual sports' governing bodies to decide who could compete. By the time the report came out, nearly all Russian track and field athletes had been banned by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

To investigate the claims against Russia, the Olympics' governing body has been relying on two disciplinary commissions. The broad investigation has been led by Schmid. Individual cases are being looked at by another commission chaired by Denis Oswald, a Swiss lawyer and former IOC executive board member.

Russia's move into wholesale Olympics cheating is often traced to 2010, when the country's athletes fell well short of expectations by winning only 15 medals at the Vancouver Winter Olympics — a bad omen as the country prepared to host the 2014 Games in Sochi. Investigators say Russian officials went to elaborate means to ensure a better showing — and it worked, as Russia's athletes more than doubled their medal count by winning 33 medals (13 of them gold), the most of any country.

But athletes' blood and urine samples have been subjected to more analysis since the Sochi Games, and in recent weeks, the IOC has been slicing into Russia's medal count, disqualifying athletes from the Russian biathlon, bobsled and cross-country skiing teams who were found to have broken anti-doping rules.

As of last week, Russia had fallen far behind the U.S. and other countries on the Sochi results list. The American team now leads the way with the 28 medals it won in 2014, with Norway second — and that is without the redistribution of medals that were taken away from Russian athletes.

The IOC has also been declaring sanctioned athletes ineligible for future Olympics as it strips them of their victories — an approach that has promised to reshape the field for the upcoming Pyeongchang Games.

"An outspoken Russian opposition figure sickened by two mysterious illnesses is now blaming the Russian government for poisoning him.

Vladimir Kara-Murza, who fell into a coma last month after a past sickness he blamed on poison, told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly in an interview on Friday that it is an unusual toxin and he is convinced it could only have come from one place.

""Given the sophisticated type of poison, I think it's people who have been or are connected with the Russian special services,"" he said.

The full interview is scheduled to air on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday.

Kara-Murza says he fell ill on Feb. 2, while in Moscow. He was rushed to the hospital, where he says he was in a coma for 10 days, kept alive by artificial respiration.

""All my major life organs just began shutting down one after another,"" says Kara-Murza. ""So it was the lungs, the kidneys, the liver, the heart just stopping.""

He has since returned to the U.S. for treatment. He is speaking out now about what he calls the attack by Russia's government at a time when President Trump has called for a closer relationship between Washington and Moscow — and is under investigation for his own ties to Putin.

Kara-Murza described to Kelly how one way he had concluded Russia's spy services were targeting him was how similar his recent onset of sickness felt to the first one, which occurred in 2015. This time, he says, it was more severe.

""This time I was really struggling to breathe,"" he said. ""That's really — I can tell you — that's really, not just painful, but really scary.""

What convinces Kara-Murza that he was, in fact, poisoned?

""First of all, that's the official diagnosis from my discharge papers, from the Russian hospital — 'Toxic action by an unidentified substance,' "" he tells NPR.

Samples of Kara-Murza's blood, hair and fingernails have been sent to toxicology labs in France, Israel and the U.S. for analysis, Kara-Murza says. Results are not back yet.

Kara-Murza, whose group, Open Russia, supports democratic reforms inside the authoritarian system dominated by Putin, is only the most recent Kremlin opponent to come under an unusual or deadly attack. His friend Boris Nemtsov, Russia's former deputy prime minister, was shot and killed two years ago.

A Russian banker, Alexander Perepilichny, fell dead in England in 2012 after having exposed tax fraud involving the Russian government and organized crime. An ex-KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko, died in 2006 after drinking what investigators concluded was tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. And many other foes of the Kremlin, including political figures and journalists, have met with violent ends.

An earlier version of the headline for this story stated that Kara-Murza blamed the Kremlin for ordering his poisoning. In fact, as he is quoted as saying in the story, he believes he was poisoned by people who have been or are connected with the Russian special services.

"President Trump told Russian officials last week that he had fired the ""nut job"" FBI Director James Comey to ease the pressure of the mounting investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, according to a report from The New York Times.

""I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,"" Trump told the Russian foreign minister and U.S. ambassador on May 10 during an Oval Office meeting, according to a transcript of the meeting read to The Times by a U.S. official. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer did not dispute the account of the conversation to The Times and, in a statement to NPR, argued that the Russia investigation was harming U.S. foreign policy.

""The President has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people. By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,"" Spicer said. ""The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.""

The May 10 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak came one day after Trump abruptly fired Comey, which the White House argued at first was because of a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pointing to Comey's mismanagement of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's private email server. Trump later said he had already decided to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's memo, which the deputy attorney general confirmed to Congress this week.

At the same meeting, The Washington Post reported earlier this week, Trump had given the Russians ""highly classified information"" that ""jeopardized a critical source of intelligence"" on ISIS that came from a key ally, which, according to later reports, was Israel. No American reporters were allowed in to document the meeting, only a Russian Foreign Ministry photographer.

The Times report on Friday afternoon is just the latest bombshell story over the past week and adds to mounting headaches for the White House just as Trump has departed for his first foreign trip as president.

Amid growing pressure, Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the Department of Justice's Russia investigation. Mueller was tapped for that post the day after another report from The Times, subsequently confirmed to NPR by two sources, that Trump had asked Comey to scuttle the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn was let go after less than a month on the job after it was revealed he had misled Vice President Pence over his conversation during the transition with Kislyak about U.S. sanctions.

Trump has denied he asked Comey to do that, though Comey wrote a memo after their encounter memorializing Trump's words to that effect (""I hope you can let this go""), according to sources close to the former FBI director.

""There is no collusion between, certainly myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians. Zero,"" Trump said Thursday during a news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.

"I admit it. I have a ""mummy tummy,"" also known as ""mommy pooch."" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby — it makes you look a few months pregnant.

I've tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.

So when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, ""Why not?""

A few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.

""We will see a dramatic change,"" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.

""You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,"" Keller says. ""That's not an unrealistic expectation.""

We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises.""

Decked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.

There is science to back up the method, she says.

""A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,"" Keller says. ""And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.""

OK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.

Putting the six-pack back together

It turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.

And it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.

""This is such a ubiquitous issue,"" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.

And it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.

""People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,"" Sharma says.

During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles responsible for a ""six pack"" stretch apart (left) to accommodate a growing fetus. After birth, the muscles don't always bounce back, leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch.

There's a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti:

In rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.

""If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,"" Sharma says. ""That's going to be more dangerous.""

A hernia may require surgery. ""So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,"" Sharma says.

Diastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart — specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.

""These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' "" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. ""People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.""

The rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. ""There shouldn't be much of gap between them.""

But during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.

That leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out — and cause mommy pooch.

To flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.

If you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.

But the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. ""Some of it is actually potentially harmful.""

Even some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.

""You have to be very careful,"" she says. ""For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.""

That said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.

Most such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details — such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.

Plus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.

""The best way is prevention,"" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. ""The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.""

But, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.

""There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,"" Sharma says. ""But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.""

In fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.

Sharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.

""We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,"" Sharma says.

The study was small — just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise — 10 minutes a day — all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.

""We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,"" Sharma says. ""We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.""

Now Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.

Tight and tighter

Back at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.

""The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,"" Keller says. ""OK. We're going to do another set.""

Sitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. ""Let the belly fully expand,"" Keller says.

And then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles — as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. ""Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,"" she says.

Then we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.

""Tight, tighter,"" Keller chants, rhythmically.

You can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.

The key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.

""The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,"" she says. ""So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.""

This is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.

Keller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.

One by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.

One woman had amazing results. ""Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,"" Keller exclaims. ""That's amazing!""

How did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.

And I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.

*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.

"When it comes to U.S. sanctions against Moscow, the Cold War has never really ended.

President Gerald Ford signed off on trade restrictions against the Soviet Union and other communist countries in a 1974 measure known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, for its congressional sponsors.

The message to Moscow: If you deny basic human rights — in this case, the right of certain people, especially Jews, to emigrate from the Soviet Union — you can't conduct normal business with the United States.

Nearly four decades passed before President Barack Obama finally lifted those restrictions and granted Russia full trade ties in a law he signed on Dec. 14, 2012. Yet that very same law, known as the Magnitsky Act, also imposed new sanctions that bar specific Russian human rights violators from entering the U.S.

So as one set of sanctions vanished, new ones appeared.

Obama followed up with additional punitive steps after Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and then again after Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Congress now appears poised to add another layer of sanctions in a measure that President Trump would then have to sign into law — or veto.

""I think the legislation is more or less a good thing,"" said Dan Fried. He was the State Department's sanctions coordinator under Obama, and as a self-described hard-liner on Russia, he favors tougher measures.

""I think the Congress was motivated by a concern that the outgoing Obama administration never responded adequately to the Russian cyberhacking into our elections,"" he said.

The Senate last month passed the proposed measure 97-2, and the House vote is expected to be similarly lopsided. The bill would give Congress a say in Russia policy if the president sought to lift sanctions unilaterally.

Embroiled in the Russia controversy, Trump has said little about Russian sanctions. He would face pressure to sign a bill with such strong bipartisan support. If he vetoed it, he would face renewed accusations that he is soft on Russia. And Congress could easily override him.

So more sanctions look quite likely. But will they be effective?

Several experts weighed in Wednesday at the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C., think tank. While they generally supported sanctions, they also raised several cautionary notes:

1. What's the goal?

Sanctions have inflicted some punishment, though it's hard to measure. They've also angered Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly the 2012 Magnitsky Act.

But if the aim is to change Russian behavior, then there is little evidence of success and no sign yet that they're potent enough to cripple Russia and force concessions.

The most substantial sanctions package came in 2014, which included steps to block international investment in Russia's energy sector, the most important part of an otherwise anemic economy.

""We saw that the 2014 sanctions have had an impact on Russia in terms of access to capital,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of the economics firm IHS and a leading authority on global energy markets. ""So the questions is 'will these [proposed] sanctions deter and punish, or will they be counterproductive?' ""

Supporters say sanctions need to be measured against Russia's actions over time. But some critics say they've become a distraction and an end in themselves.

For example, U.S. and Russian officials met at the State Department this week to talk about the punishment imposed in December, when the U.S. seized two Russian diplomatic compounds — one outside New York City, the other outside Washington.

Critics say the two countries should be focused on matters like the war in Syria and the turmoil in Ukraine.

2. The U.S. needs partners

""We have to recognize that unilateral sanctions generally don't work,"" said Richard Morningstar, head of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council. ""It's necessary to have the support of allies.""

The 2014 energy sanctions against Russia have worked, he said, because the U.S. negotiated them in partnership with the European Union. The current measure under consideration would expand those sanctions but would be put into force only by the United States.

Morningstar also cited the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, which came about after the U.S. persuaded the Europeans and others to stop buying Iranian oil. While Trump and many other Republicans are critical of the nuclear deal, there is a broad consensus that the sanctions helped push Iran to the negotiating table.

""We've learned in the past the difficulty of enforcing unilateral sanctions. And we've learned the hard way,"" Morningstar said.

The U.S. economy is more than 10 times larger than Russia's, with an annual gross domestic product of more than $18 trillion compared with $1.5 trillion. But the Russian economy is still too large to be severely damaged by U.S. sanctions alone, said David Mortlock, a international trade lawyer who worked on Russia sanctions at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.

""The Russia sanctions program is very different than any other sanctions program,"" Mortlock said. ""On a country like Iran, every twist of the dial was fairly significant. Iran is a large economy, but nowhere near the scale of Russia.""

3. How will Putin respond?

So far, the Russian president has pressed ahead with provocative actions despite sanctions.

Fried, the former State Department official, said this is why it's important to step up the pressure.

""Putin is making a calculation that he can lean on Ukraine longer than we can resist,"" he said. ""He may decide to cut a deal when he has concluded that Ukraine and the West will resist effectively. He will not cut a deal if he thinks Ukraine will collapse or we will collapse.""

Russia will respond in some form to new U.S. restrictions, Fried added. Days after Obama signed the 2012 sanctions, Russia banned U.S. adoptions of Russian children.

""We shouldn't wring our hands too much and worry about what the Russians are going to do to us,"" he said. ""We should keep thinking about what we're going to do to them in the interests of reaching a deal, so we can take off the sanctions.""

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told members of Congress that he knew President Trump planned to fire FBI Director James Comey before he wrote a memo that the White House has cited to justify the termination.

""On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader,"" Rosenstein said in his opening comments in private briefings with both the House and Senate this week, according to a statement he released. (The next day, May 9, the president fired Comey, and the White House cited Rosenstein's memo to justify that decision.)

""In one of my first meetings with then-Sen. Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI,"" Rosenstein continued. ""Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.""

In that memo — which the White House initially used as the justification for Comey's firing, before Trump admitted he had made up his mind well before that — Rosenstein outlined why Comey should be terminated, namely his handling of the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's private email server almost a year ago.

""I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply ingrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election,"" Rosenstein said.

Comey would later reopen the Clinton investigation less than two weeks before Election Day after additional emails surfaced, a controversial decision that many Democrats — including Clinton herself — believe helped tip the election Trump's way. Trump praised that decision at the time, though, saying it ""took a lot of guts.""

Trump also later admitted that the ongoing Russia investigation and possible ties between his campaign associates played a role in his decision to fire Comey. On Wednesday, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to take over the Justice Department's Russia probe.

Rosenstein underscored that the memo he wrote was ""not a legal brief"" and was ""not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination...[and] not a survey of FBI morale or performance"" but instead ""a candid internal memorandum about the FBI director's public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation.""

""I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it,"" Rosenstein underscored.

Rosenstein also told senators that he was ""not aware"" of a request Comey made for additional resources for the Russia investigation shortly before his firing. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe has also testified he wasn't aware of any such request. A source with direct knowledge confirmed that Comey had indeed requested additional resources for the FBI investigation, which NPR has previously reported.

Read Rosenstein's opening statements:

Good afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of FBI Director James Comey, although I know you understand that I will not discuss the special counsel's ongoing investigation. Most importantly, I want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation. There never has been, and never will be, any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the United States Department of Justice.

* * *

Before I discuss the events of the past two weeks, I want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former Director Comey. I have known Jim Comey since approximately 2002. In 2005, when Mr. Comey was Deputy Attorney General, he participated in selecting me to serve as a U.S. Attorney. As a federal prosecutor, he was a role model. His speeches about leadership and public service inspired me.

On July 5, 2016, Director Comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails. At the start of the press conference, the Director stated that he had ""not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice.... They do not know what I am about to say.""

Director Comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose ""what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice."" He proceeded to disclose details about the evidence; assert that the American people ""deserve"" to know details; declare that no ""reasonable"" prosecutor would file charges; and criticize Secretary Clinton.

I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.

There are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized. Such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors, and protect the rights of citizens.

Director Comey attended the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office training seminar on October 27, 2016, and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his analysis, but I believe that he made his decisions in good faith.

The next day, October 28, Mr. Comey sent his letter to the Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. He subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter. I completely disagree. He again usurped the authority of the Department of Justice, by sending the letter over the objection of the Department of Justice; flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions; and guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.

Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Director Comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his explanations, particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment. Nonetheless, I respected him personally.

Former Department of Justice officials from both political parties have criticized Director Comey's decisions. It was not just an isolated mistake; the series of public statements about the email investigation, in my opinion, departed from the proper role of the FBI Director and damaged public confidence in the Bureau and the Department.

In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI. Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.

On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.

I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comey's public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation.

I chose the issues to include in my memorandum.

Before finalizing the memorandum on May 9, I asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it. That attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during multiple administrations. He was familiar with the issues. I informed the senior attorney that the President was going to remove Director Comey, that I was writing a memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my own concerns, and that I wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate. He concurred with the points raised in my memorandum. I also asked several other career Department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits.

My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law.

My memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct; the Inspector General will render his judgment about that issue in due course.

My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination.

My memorandum is not a survey of FBI morale or performance.

My memorandum is not a press release.

It is a candid internal memorandum about the FBI Director's public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation.

I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9.

I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.

* * *

Finally, I want to address the media claims that the FBI asked for additional resources for the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. I am not aware of any such request. Moreover, I consulted my staff and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request.

"A former national security adviser to the Trump campaign says he had concerns about Carter Page's visit to Moscow in the summer of 2016 — chief among them the possibility that he would embarrass the campaign.

J.D. Gordon also told NPR that Page as well George Papadopoulos, who recently pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his own Russia contacts, were marginal figures in the Trump world. Both men served as members of the then-candidate's foreign policy team, but they were not central figures with a meaningful voice, he said.

""They were peripheral members of a relatively peripheral advisory committee,"" Gordon told NPR by text message. ""They had no campaign email addresses, no assigned office space, no building passes, no responsibilities and very little access to campaign leadership.""

He described Page and Papadopoulos as ""volunteers,"" adding that ""nobody cared what they did or what they said, as long as they didn't embarrass the campaign. Their roles are being grotesquely overblown for political reasons.""

The entire campaign foreign policy team has come under increased scrutiny as more details have emerged about contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russians.

Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russia interactions. According to court papers, a professor with links to the Russian government told Papadopoulos in April 2016 — months before the Russian hacks of the Democratic National Committee were public — that the Kremlin had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.

Papadopoulos reported back to senior campaign officials — now identified as Sam Clovis, Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort — about his communications with Russians and their proxies.

Gordon, who worked as a Pentagon spokesman during the George W. Bush administration, said he learned about Papadopolous' Russia contacts when the court documents were unsealed Oct. 30. With Page, however, Gordon was more directly involved.

Gordon said Page asked about going to Moscow to speak at the commencement ceremony in July for the New Economic School, a Moscow university.

""I did have concerns about Carter's plan to visit Moscow,"" Gordon said. ""I declined to forward his request up the chain of command and told him it was a bad idea.""

Asked why he was worried about Page's trip, Gordon replied: ""Many reasons, though embarrassing the campaign was a major factor.""

In the end, Page did travel to Moscow. In the transcript from his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Page told lawmakers that he met with members of the Russian government, including a deputy prime minister, as well as representatives of state-owned businesses.

Page offered his campaign colleagues a ""readout"" about his time in Moscow. In an email to Gordon and Tera Dahl, a former Breitbart columnist who was working with the campaign, Page said he would send them a memo ""regarding some incredible insights and outreach I've received form a few Russian legislators and senior members of the presidential administration.""

Page told lawmakers that he believes he did indeed send them a memo.

Gordon told NPR that he doesn't recall all of Page's emails ""and certainly not the one he allegedly sent from Russia.""

After Page went around Gordon for permission from the campaign to go to Moscow, Gordon said he generally tuned him out.

""I had absolutely zero desire to hear anything he had to say, and rarely spoke to him again,"" he said. ""And on those rare occasions, he never brought up his trip and I didn't ask.""

"In music and the culture it reflects, 2017 was predictably unpredictable: idols fell, empires shook, consensus was scarce. All this week, NPR Music is talking with artists, makers and thinkers whose work captured something unique about a chaotic year, and hinted at bigger revelations around the bend. 

Digital technology has dominated music-making and listening for decades, but its effects have hit a little harder lately. Streaming has overtaken downloads as the music industry's primary revenue generator. Devices like the voice-operated  Amazon Echo have surged in popularity, making the seamlessness of the digital experience feel like part of our bodies themselves. A redheaded heartthrob with an acoustic guitar claimed the top slot on Spotify's year-end chart, where every other artist in the top five hails from the digitally constructed realms of hip-hop, R&B; and EDM, by crafting the pop-star equivalent of a dancehall track.

In the midst of this irrevocable shift, Damon Krukowski has emerged as a kind and clear-headed navigator. In April, the 53-year-old musician, writer and creative bon vivant published The New Analog: Listening and Reconnecting in a Digital World, a kind of guidebook to our new sonic realities. Over the summer, working with the production company Radiotopia, he launched a companion podcast called Ways of Hearing. Not only is the podcast a clear and emotionally resonant exploration of how digital culture has changed making and listening to music; it is also a potent political intervention, revealing ways in which listeners can be more than passive consumers shaped by algorithmically constructed playlists, and perhaps become active players who fully grasp and make choices about the music that so deeply affects their lives.

Ways of Hearing is divided into six episodes, structured around big themes like ""Money,"" ""Power"" and ""Love."" Krukowski personalizes these abstractions by having listeners ""wear my headphones for a bit"" — going through the same thickets of comprehension and new fields of perception that he, an indie rock veteran and child of the analog age, experienced as he learned to become a digital savant. Krukowski is not an optimist about these changes, nor is he a doomsayer. His measured, inquisitive, but always clear tone is one thing that makes Ways of Hearing a delight. The other is the texture of the podcast itself: Working with sound designer Ian Cross, Krukowski has created a series about music that feels like music in its own right. 

Just back from a Japanese tour with Damon & Naomi, the beloved indie-folk duo he shares with his wife, Naomi Yang, Krukowski spoke from his home studio in Boston, Mass. about learning how to ""play"" a podcast, using his own life as source material and writing a mini-jeremiad that feels like a map of a new world. 

Ann Powers: In your book, you take apart listening experiences and help readers understand what they may be taking for granted when hearing. The podcast has the same goal — but there, you get to use sound to do it. What did you learn in that transition, turning a book about listening into an actual listening experience?

Damon Krukowski: I thought of the podcast in part because I was approached to do an audiobook version of The New Analog. And that exists: I did it for Audible.com. But I thought, this is kind of a silly exercise! Reading a book about sound aloud, without taking into account all the potential use of sound as an expressive tool. So, I pitched the podcast very confidently to the wonderful people at Radiotopia, saying, ""Well, I've never made a podcast before, but I know how to make a record so I understand sound.""

When I came down to making it, I discovered podcasting is actually its own form — so I had to learn quickly, from scratch, how to make this audio experience really read through language and not just music. It's a different thing: Podcasting is very, very emotional. Of course, music is an emotional medium, but there's something about the language in podcasting going straight into your ear. You're usually alone when you're listening to it. It's a very intimate experience. And you really can't use the same analytical tools that you can in a written book; it's more of the heart than the mind. I didn't get that until I started doing it.  

I felt that throughout Ways of Hearing, you acted as a kind of sound detective, leading us through these inquiries. There's a musical quality to each episode — music illustrates and interrupts the narrative, but also continues it. It works in a rhythm with your voice and with the voices of the people you talk to. 

That  is a great description of what I was trying to achieve: to have the listener wear my headphones for a bit, or sit in front of my speakers and let me point something out to you. And my sound designer, Ian Cross, really took my ideas about that and made them real. For each episode, I gave him a palette of songs or sounds that I thought would speak to the whole episode that he could then play with.

The process actually reminds me of an experience Naomi and I had making our first record with our producer Kramer, who did all of [our previous band] Galaxie 500's records, too. I remember we gave him a cassette tape of things we were listening to, which included bits of The Magic Flute and some Max Roach drumming, just things that were inspiring us at the time: ""Here's what's in our ears."" And he took it and he put all the sounds on our record — there are little bits of sound that he just kind of wove into in the background of our songs. Ian did very much that same thing.

That connects to an underlying theme in your work, which is how a subject encounters sound: Even if people are hearing the same thing they each bring their own history, community and language to the experience.

Music blends communal experience with extreme subjectivity. And that's what makes it so personally powerful, in any genre of music: You listen to it from your point of view, from your ears. That's what I'm trying to get at in the book and podcast: In the midst of this rushed digital communication, which feels so universal, so instant, so simultaneous, don't forget it's highly subjective. You've got the tools to think about your own position with regard to this material, and your own choices about how to engage with it.  

In books and writing about digital technology — a field that is growing — we often have naysayers or boosters. We have the Jaron Laniers of the world saying, ""This is a disaster, we're losing our humanity."" And then there's anyone who gives a TED Talk, saying, ""This is leading us forward into a great new frontier."" You seem to occupy a space between: You use and appreciate the tools,  but you also want to question our position in relationship to them and the power dynamics behind that.

That was one of the motivations for writing The New Analog: There was only this tiny little narrow bit of years during which people lived through this switch, and I thought, ""I'd better leave a testament, because this isn't going to happen again."" I wasn't confident that I had this big powerful conclusion to offer,  but I thought I could leave a document that would be useful later, because people are going to forget what it was to live without the digital tools.

What do you think about analog fetishists? There are certainly a lot of them today. Does it ever feel like they're clinging to a cliff and eventually they'll just fall off?

To try and hold on to old technology in its entirety is pretty much impossible. At the same time, I love the romance and the energy and the attention to detail that people can put into it. I think Jack White is doing amazing things. But most of me, especially when we're making our own records, just doesn't have the time, patience or money to go down that rabbit hole. It takes an immense effort, which is why I admire the people who do it really well. 

Take the simplest example: The biggest switch we've all made is from tape decks to hard drives. The big difference, to me, is that tape decks have to be maintained and hard drives don't. They either fail or they work, so all you have to do is back them up. And when they fail they just stop.

You don't have to clean them, you don't have to test them.

You don't have to calibrate them, you don't have to keep them in perfect working order. We actually switched to digital recording as soon as we started a home studio, because I'd seen what it took to run a tape deck properly, and I just thought, ""We can't do that."" We could've maybe come up with the capital to invest in a tape machine, but the idea of keeping it running well was beyond us. At that point it became a choice: Do we have this machine that's not running properly or do we just switch over to this crappy new medium? At the time it was digital audio tape. It was the worst! It was on VHS cassettes. The transfer was so bad, when you turned them on, you heard all these clunks like you did in your VCR. The machines broke all the time. But when they broke, you threw them away.

And that planned obsolescence is an effect of capitalism, which is another an undercurrent in your work this year. You have an episode of the podcast about money, but money can't be confined to one episode; it plays into every single thing you talk about.

It's very true. In the end, the book was intended to be a political gesture. My editor received it that way, which delighted me. When I first put out the proposal, it could have been taken up as strictly a music book.

Or a how-to book, in a weird way. How to survive technology.

A guide to living with tech. It is both those things. But I'm motivated by an interest in laying bare some of the root issues involved in these decisions that we make, or that we decline to make, in the digital environment. There's a lot of acceptance of this role that's being defined for us by these huge corporations we engage with every day: The social media ones, the manufactures of our digital tools. It seems we have no choice  the matter, [but] the fact is we do. At its heart this is a project about waking people up to that situation.

In 2012 you wrote a widely seen essay for Pitchfork about streaming and what it was doing to musicians' income. That's part of an ongoing debate as those services' playlists have become the center of many people's listening practices. How do you think the relationship to streaming has changed since you first wrote that essay?

I think it's getting worse. When I wrote that article, I had this feeling that this system was unfair. But I didn't have the feeling that it was going to spiral in that direction endlessly, and now it feels like it is: the consolidation in so few hands, the control of what people are hearing.

The playlist could be a new creative platform for DJing, or even making a mixtape. But because of the scale of digital communications and the monopolies that we're dealing with, certain playlists have so much power now. It's out of scale. It's belittling people's individual exploration of music. It's discouraging people from building their own playlists. And that is the opposite of where I would wish this system would go, because the other side of digital sharing online is so beautifully democratic and utopian — which is full access to everything ever, all the time.

I was just in Japan on tour, and I'm thrilled that I can come home and research an artist I discovered in a record store over there, Morio Agata — I brought back one LP, but I can find all the other LPs online now. Here's the ironic footnote: I have to do it by going to pirate sites. He's famous in Japan and not outside, and when you're looking in places that are not being pushed by the services you have access to, [that means] looking outside the entire system. Instead of it being this glorious sharing of everything out there, we're splitting it up into two Internets. One is complete corporate control and domination, and the other is what's left over of what [the Internet] started as, which was a free access and sharing of information. And the free part is getting smaller and smaller.

There's a tension in how we listen to music now between real choice, the illusion of choice, and seductive passivity. With on-demand services, I can choose something I've never heard before at any time, but the platform's interface encourages me to just sit back and listen to the playlists it promotes. What makes the playlist so addictive that we'll give up what choice we have — the same way we just scroll for hours on Facebook instead of using it more actively?

I thought about this when I was making the ""Power"" episode in the podcast.  I went to Forced Exposure, a music distributor here in Boston, and I went to City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco and talked to [executive director] Elaine Katzenberger there. What I was thinking about is, what is that difference? Because I knew experientially that walking into a bookstore is a different thing than going online and finding the book you want on Amazon. If you frame it in terms of choice, Amazon wins. If you frame it in terms of accessibility, Amazon wins. That's bizarre, because you'd think those would be key elements in making City Lights a great bookstore. But there are these other elements that the digital platform really has trouble reproducing. It's scale — a personal scale, a human scale. It's hard on the digital platform to maintain the natural small scale of a business the size of City Lights or Forced Exposure.

Startups want to go global: Can there be billions of users?  Can it scale endlessly? That's what they're always looking for; it's a factor in how these products and companies are set up. The  products for which the answer is yes are the ones we're stuck with. But there's a lot to be said for things that can't scale. You can't scale a relationship. You can't scale eccentricity. 

You can't scale an indie rock scene.

Very much so, as I also learned firsthand. My band came of age in a very small-scale indie scene that then, because of Nirvana and a couple of other factors, turned into a massively different, scaled activity.

This makes me want to to quickly mention the ""loudness wars"" chapter of your book and podcast — because the sound of rock changed when the scale changed.

Absolutely. Those records we were making with Kramer in the late '80s, they couldn't fit on the commercial radio formats. They didn't have the right volume and the right compression. They were made for the formats that we were making them for: people's homes and college radio stations, where they were placed next to other songs that had similar dynamics.

And just sound great in small rooms.  

And not to get too off-topic, but this is a gripe that I have right now about festivals dominating live music. ""Well, gigs are good, let's scale it up. It's nice to have 250 people in a room; what if we had 25,000?"" You can't play the same music to 25,000 people. It doesn't work. You have to change the actual sounds you make. You have to change the way those sounds are amplified. Ultimately, you have to change who you are as a musician. 

Do you think these trends can be disrupted? Can the flattening you describe be countered by the artists somehow? Or the audience?

I have enough utopian in me to think so. In fact, I think it's happening all the time — it's just not being rewarded financially or becoming dominant. A simple example, which I tend to raise a lot because I really like it, is [the online music distribution and marketing company] Bandcamp. Bandcamp is to Spotify or Apple Music what Forced Exposure or an indie record store is to the major label system. And the simple difference is that bands and labels that upload their material onto Bandcamp control more of the parameters of how that music is received, so you build a little bit more of your own context around your music.

Ultimately it's the loss of context, or replacement of your context with a corporate context, that makes for this flatness or sameness that I see in major streaming services and on festival circuit. You go to see a band in a regular size venue, the band sets the tone for the night. It's in collaboration with the audience and the venue, but you see the band on their terms, in so many ways. At a festival you don't: You see the band at the festival's terms. It's very hard to break through that. I've seen people try, and more power to them, but it's near impossible because the medium is so overpowering. Same with streaming services: The medium takes over and the individual context of all these individual creators, with all their quirky ideas and differences, gets blurred.

I want to end on a positive note. Could you talk about your experience in Serbia,  which really stood out to me when you described it on the podcast? It's like a beautiful fairy tale, in which the analog and digital worlds coalesced. 

I went to Belgrade, in Serbia, on tour with Naomi. This was some years ago — I understand Belgrade has become quite different now, but this was still close to the end of the war in former Yugoslavia, and Belgrade was still under sanctions and really cut off from the rest of Europe. We crossed a barrier, and all our digital tools went dead. We'd been in the car without a physical map — we only had Google Maps — and then we crossed the border and Google Maps went blank because it had been knocked out deliberately. All of a sudden, and had to fall back on old touring habits to find our way.

The miracle of the situation, and the beauty of it, was that we got to the venue and people knew our music. If Google Maps couldn't make it there and our cell phone service couldn't make it there, you know our record distributor couldn't get there — but what could get there was the utopian side of digital communications: piracy, bootlegging, online sharing for free, could get our music into an otherwise sanctioned part of the world. We had gone through all these political and physical barriers made to keep us separate, and yet there we were playing our music to people who actually knew it.  That, to me, is the utopian thing about digital communication: It's global, so you can communicate with people that are alien to you and make them familiar. And that is the ideal.

Don't let these tools separate us into the alien and the familiar. That's the crazy filter bubble thing: ""OK, the digital platform is going to sort the world out into those I'm comfortable communicating with and everybody else."" It should be exactly the other way around, which is, ""I can hear this record from Japan without having to get on a plane. I can reach out and explore the music and make it familiar in this new way."" It's the elimination of borders. That's what's gorgeous and beautiful and dreamy about the digital platform, and what I don't want to give up about it.

"Cardi B is determined to finish her breakout year with a bang. The Bronx rapper has teamed up with 21 Savage for the new single ""Bartier Cardi.""

The 30 Roc and Cheez Beatz-produced track finds Cardi and 21 trading bars about their cars, clothes and riches. Both artists hew to a fairly simple rhyme scheme, making the track perfect for Cardi's fans, a.k.a. Bardi Gang, to belt out in the club.

Cardi has been collaborating all year, appearing alongside the likes of Migos, G-Eazy, A$AP Rocky and more. But ""Bartier Cardi"" is the first follow-up single to Cardi's star-making, triple-platinum ""Bodak Yellow.""

Earlier this week, Cardi made a charming appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this week to promote the new song. ""I had to name it Bartier because I didn't want Cartier to sue me.""

""I already feel like a winner,"" Cardi told Fallon, when asked about her 2018 Grammy nominations. ""I never thought me, you know what I'm saying? Like, I already won — what's good?""

"President Obama awarded outgoing Vice President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday afternoon.

Calling the former longtime Delaware senator ""the best vice president America's ever had"" and a ""lion of American history,"" Obama gave his White House partner the surprise award in an emotional ceremony, initially billed as a farewell.

After extolling the job that Biden has done, Obama ended it with the unexpected news that he was giving the vice president the nation's highest civilian honor, with distinction — a designation most recently given to President Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and Gen. Colin Powell.

""To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully,"" Obama said.

Overcome with tears and completely caught off guard by the award, Biden praised the president as ""remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country"" who had truly treated him like an equal partner in governance.

""This honor is not only well beyond what I deserve, but it's a reflection of the generosity of your spirit,"" Biden told Obama. ""I don't deserve this. But I know it came from the president's heart.""

The two have enjoyed an unusually close working relationship over the past eight years, and Obama himself even joked at the outset of the ceremony that ""this also gives the Internet one last chance to talk about our 'bromance.' ""

Throughout the ceremony it was evident not just how close the two men were but how close their families and staffs had become, and Obama said his ""family is honored to call ourselves honorary Bidens.""

Obama has frequently said that picking Biden, his former primary rival, as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. Before accepting the nomination, Biden had spent more than three decades in the Senate, amassing a large portfolio and body of work, including stints as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The president said, laughing, that the people of Delaware sent Biden to the Senate as soon as they could, electing him to the Senate at the age of 29 (he turned the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in).

But before Biden could even head to Washington, his life would be marked with unspeakable tragedy for the first time. While Christmas shopping, his first wife and 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car wreck; his sons Hunter and Beau were injured in the accident. Biden considered resigning before he even took office but was persuaded not to. He was sworn into office at the hospital beside his sons, and for years he would famously commute back and forth every day on Amtrak to be with his family. Later on, he would meet and marry his now-wife, Jill, and they would have a daughter together, Ashley.

In 2015, tragedy would strike the Biden family again when his eldest son, Beau, the former Delaware attorney general who was long seen as his father's political heir, died at the age of 46 from brain cancer. The loss came as the elder Biden was weighing whether he should make his own run at the Oval Office to succeed Obama. Months later, the still very emotional vice president acknowledged his window had passed and said that he wouldn't launch his own presidential campaign.

An earlier version of this story said there had been only three medals given previously ""with distinction."" In fact, there have been more with that designation. The three mentioned referred only to the most recent honorees.

"Updated 2 p.m.

A day late, the Justice Department complied this morning with a federal court order and released part of a security clearance form dealing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' contacts with foreign governments.

On June 12, a judge had ordered the agency to provide the information within 30 days, a deadline that passed on Wednesday.

In a filing Thursday morning with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department released that part of Sessions' form which poses the question:

""Have you or any of your immediate family in the past seven (7) years [bold font in original] had any contact with a foreign government, its establishment (such as embassy, consulate, agency, military service, intelligence or security service, etc.) or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S.?""

Sessions checked ""No.""

A recently launched ethics watchdog group called American Oversight filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March for sections of the Standard Form 86 relating to Sessions' contact ""with any official of the Russian government.""

The group then filed a lawsuit in April after it said the government didn't provide the documents.

""Jeff Sessions is our nation's top law enforcement officer, and it is shocking one of his first acts after being named Attorney General was to mislead his own agency about a matter of national security,"" the group's executive director, Austin Evers, said in a statement.

The Standard Form 86, more commonly called SF86, is a detailed form required to obtain security clearance for certain government positions. It's the same form presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has recently had to revise after omitting meetings with Russian officials.

Sessions has admitted to speaking with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, at least twice in 2016, which he did not disclose at his confirmation hearing. But in June, Sessions testified to senators that the ""suggestion that I participated in any collusion"" with the Russian government ""is an appalling and detestable lie.""

In a statement last May, the Justice Department said Sessions ""was instructed [by the FBI investigator handling the background check] not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities.""

American Oversight says it's nonpartisan, but its staff has connections to Democrats, according to USA Today.

"Spare a thought for the poor U.S.-Russia Joint Impenetrable Cybersecurity Unit, which didn't even survive an entire news cycle this weekend.

President Trump pitched the joint cyber-team with Russia in a tweet on Sunday.

Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..

He went on to rule out the idea in a second tweet on Sunday evening.

The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!

Then again, the notion had about as much chance of acceptance in the U.S. national security world as ketchup on a hot dog in Chicago.

""It's not the dumbest idea I've ever heard, but it's pretty close,"" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, appearing on Meet the Press.

""Partnering with Putin on a 'Cyber Security Unit' is akin to partnering with Assad on a 'Chemical Weapons Unit,' "" wrote Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio on Twitter.

""A cyber security working group with the very perpetrators of the attack on our election? Might as well just mail our ballots to Moscow,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. He also sounded off on Twitter.

Administration leaders, however, said something must be done: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Sunday that Washington and Moscow needed a ""framework"" with which to negotiate some agreements on cybersecurity and to keep future elections secure.

""What we agreed on the cyber front is to explore a framework under which we might begin to have agreement on how to deal with these very complex issues of cyber threats, cybersecurity [and] cyber intrusions,"" he said. ""This is a challenge, obviously, for us globally.""

It's unclear what incentive Russia might have to reciprocate: Its leaders likely have just as much to fear from American cyber-capabilities as Washington does from Russian ones. And there are diplomatic and political games at work, too.

Trump's sometimes-yes, sometimes-it's-a-witch hunt position means it would be difficult for him to push the issue.

And according to Tillerson and Trump — there were no independent accounts of their meeting with their Russian counterparts — Russia's Vladimir Putin denied any Russian government role in the election interference, as he has in the past. How could Putin discuss something of which he has no knowledge?

(Putin has been less categorical on the question of whether some Russians, outside the view of officialdom, might have attacked the U.S. The Russian leader loves to play the Cheshire Cat.)

Current and former U.S. intelligence leaders are categorical: The evidence is compelling and the conclusion is solid. What's more, former FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and others warn they expect Russia will be back with more interference in the 2018 and 2020 elections.

According to the president's latest comments, he accepts that Russia launched some of the cyberattacks the U.S. intelligence community has documented, but also believes ""others"" may have meddled, too — though former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says there's no evidence any other foreign power was involved.

That means Trump is in a box, politically. He and Tillerson have cited Putin's denials as a way to explain there was nowhere else for them to go on the election meddling; that this was an impasse they could not bridge. So the more Trump discusses the issue, the more attention he draws to his newest position acknowledging that Russia did play some role — and to the fact that he and Tillerson got nothing out of Putin about it in their meeting.

That lack of enthusiasm at the leadership level is just one reason why the impenetrable cyber group probably wouldn't have gone anywhere. Another is that, at the working level, American national security officials already know quite a bit about Russian cyber-operations — in ways they might wish they didn't.

Russia's intelligence agencies are their leading cyber-antagonists — they've compromised White House and Pentagon emails, stolen secrets and may have helped exploit powerful hacking tools lost by the National Security Agency and CIA.

Plus Russian spies and hackers are blamed for waves of snooping on the American technology and financial sectors and may be linked with recent cyberattacks on U.S nuclear power plants.

The U.S. government knows so much about Russian cyber-exploits, in fact, that last January, the Justice Department had sufficient evidence to indict four Russians over attacks against the U.S. Two of them were intelligence officers with the FSB, the modern-day successor agency to Russia's infamous KGB.

The people in that case are accused of a major cyberattack against Yahoo, but the unit for which they work, the FSB's Center 18, is partly blamed for last year's election interference.

The unit is also the FBI's formal point of contact for cyber-operations with its Russian counterpart.

"Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was in direct contact with WikiLeaks at the same time the muckraking website was publishing hacked emails from Democratic officials that proved damaging to the Clinton campaign, according to several major publications.

Following the reports, Trump Jr. acknowledged the contact in a tweet detailing one exchange with the radical transparency organization.

The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, in articles published late Monday, said that then-candidate Donald Trump's eldest son used the messaging feature on Twitter to communicate with WikiLeaks, which in turn alerted the campaign to the impending release of the hacked emails.

The publications report that the messages between Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks were among thousands of documents turned over to Congress as part of its ongoing investigation into claims that Russia interfered in the November election — a finding backed unanimously by U.S. intelligence agencies, which have said that the Kremlin aimed to aid Donald Trump's campaign.

WikiLeaks was founded by Australian computer programmer Julian Assange, who rose to global prominence in 2010 when he published damning classified information from Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst then known as Bradley Manning, and video from the Afghanistan war.

Since 2012, Assange has been seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, in an effort to avoided an arrest warrant in Sweden on sexual assault charges. Those charges were dropped earlier this year.

U.S. intelligence agencies believe WikiLeaks served as a conduit for Russian efforts to sway the election through the release of hacked emails. An intelligence assessment put out in January concluded ""with high confidence"" that the GRU, Russia's foreign intelligence agency, ""relayed material it acquired from the [Democratic National Committee] and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.""

The Atlantic reports that in its communications with Trump Jr., WikiLeaks ""made a series of increasingly bold requests,"" which included ""urging the Trump campaign on Election Day to reject the results of the election as rigged, and requesting that the president-elect tell Australia to appoint [Assange] ambassador to the United States.""

That back-and-forth — or at least a portion of it — was released in a tweet by Trump Jr. on Monday.

Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.  How ironic!  1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykA

The first direct contact appears to date from Sept. 20, 2016, when a message sent from WikiLeaks' Twitter account to Trump Jr. tips him off about the launch of an anti-Trump website, putintrump.org. Trump Jr. responds: ""Off the record, I don't know who that is, but I'll ask around.""

On Oct. 3, WikiLeaks, writing a day before it was set to announce the release of hacked Democratic emails, wrote to Trump Jr.: ""Hiya. It'd be great if you guys could comment on /push this story."" To which Trump Jr. replies: ""Already did that earlier today. It's amazing what she can get away with,"" in apparent reference to Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. then sends a message asking: ""What's behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?""

It wasn't until Oct. 12 that he got a response: ""Hey Donald, great to see you and your dad talking about our publications.""

Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!

""Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us,"" it went on to say, adding a link to hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Fifteen minutes later, candidate Trump tweeted: ""Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!""

In a subsequent message to Trump Jr., WikiLeaks proposes what it acknowledges is ""an unusual idea"":

""Leak us one or more of your father's tax returns,"" the message suggests, ""Most of the harm has already been done by the nyt [New York Times] and pre-empted by your father (tax writedowns).""

""If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,"" the message continues. ""That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing about Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won't be perceived as coming from a 'pro-Trump' 'pro-Russian' source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.""

Trump Jr. does not appear to have responded to the request.

On Oct. 14, weeks after Trump Jr. began communicating with WikiLeaks, then vice presidential running mate Mike Pence went on Fox News to deny allegations that the campaign was ""in cahoots"" with WikiLeaks, saying: ""Nothing could be further from the truth."" The vice president's office on Monday said he ""was never aware"" of contacts between the campaign and WikiLeaks.

White House lawyer, Ty Cobb declined on Monday to comment on the latest reports, referring instead to Trump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas.

""All sides in this campaign, the Clinton side, the Trump side, were monitoring WikiLeaks to see what they would publish next,"" Futerfas said, according to the Post. ""If The Washington Post or the New York Times was looking to see what was being released, does that suggest any impropriety on their part? Of course not.""

Assange tweeted Monday that he cannot confirm the alleged direct messages with the Trump campaign because WikiLeaks ""does not keep such records"" and asserted that ""the Atlantic's presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context.""

The messages between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign come months after revelations that Trump Jr. exchanged emails with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and met with her in Trump Tower seeking ""dirt"" on Clinton.

And, as The Atlantic notes: ""The messages exchanged with WikiLeaks add a second instance in which Trump Jr. appears eager to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton, despite its provenance.""

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that WikiLeaks published classified information about Chelsea Manning. Actually, the information was provided by Manning, who was then an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning.

"Updated at 3:35 p.m ET

President Trump's outside lawyer flatly denied that the president ever asked former FBI Director James Comey for a pledge of loyalty, and he accused Comey of disclosing privileged communications with the president to the news media, without authorization.

Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, went on the offensive only a couple of hours after Comey concluded his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee — a highly anticipated performance that was broadcast live on national television.

Kasowitz highlighted Comey's most favorable point for the president: that Trump was not personally the target of an FBI investigation. But he challenged Comey's account of a private dinner he had with the president on Jan. 27, during Trump's first full week in the White House.

The president ""never told Comey, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,' in form or substance,"" Kasowitz said in a statement, rebutting Comey's testimony that Trump appeared to be trying to create a patronage relationship with the FBI director.

Comey said he was so concerned by the dinner, and the perceived threat to the FBI's independence, that he documented that and other meetings with the president in personal memos. After he was fired, Comey asked a friend to leak the contents of a memo about an Oval Office meeting that he had with Trump to a newspaper reporter.

""Comey's excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information ... appears to be entirely retaliatory,"" Kasowitz said in the statement. ""We will leave it [to] the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks [sic] should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.""

The lawyer also accused Comey of misstating the timing of the leak.

""Although Mr. Comey testified he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from these memos the day before the referenced tweet.""

In fact, Comey's timeline appears to be correct.

Trump tweeted on Friday, May 12, that ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

Comey said it was that tweet that prompted him to ask a friend to reveal the contents of the memo to a reporter the following Tuesday, May 16. The Times ran a story about the memo contents later that day. Although the Times also reported on May 11 — before Trump's tweet — about Comey's private dinner with the president, that story made no reference to Comey's contemporaneous memos. New York Times reporters corroborated Comey's timeline on Thursday after Kasowitz's statement.

The president himself was uncharacteristically restrained during the Comey hearing. Trump didn't send out a single tweet.

Trump's elder son was active on Twitter, however, defending his dad. Donald Trump Jr. took particular aim at Comey's claim that by saying, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,"" the president was effectively directing the FBI director to close the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""Hoping and telling are two very different things,"" the younger Trump tweeted. ""Knowing my father for 39 years, when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means.""

3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he ""orders or tells"" you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means

Administration spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to project an air of normalcy, telling reporters, ""It's a regular Thursday at the White House.""

She said the president spent much of the morning in meetings with his national security team, although a person close to his legal team said Trump planned to watch at least part of the Comey hearing with his attorney.

Sanders declined to answer specific questions about Comey's testimony, referring those to the president's lawyer. She did take issue, though, with Comey's claim that Trump is less than honest.

""I can definitely say the president is not a liar,"" Sanders said. ""And I think it's frankly insulting that that question would be asked.""

Comey accused Trump of lying in multiple instances in the hearing.

Trump later addressed the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a group of religious conservatives who have been supportive of the president. He made no direct reference to the Comey hearing in his speech, though he did liken himself to people of faith who feel persecuted by the government.

""As you know, we're under siege,"" Trump said, promising to protect religious liberty. ""You understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever.""

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the president's contacts with Comey, saying any breach of the usual firewalls was a product of inexperience, not nefarious intent.

""Of course there needs to be a degree of independence"" between the FBI and the White House, Ryan said. ""The president is new at this. He's new to government. So he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships.""

During the hearing, Comey offered a different take.

""Why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office"" before raising the Flynn investigation, if the president's intent was innocent? Comey asked.

""That, to me, as an investigator, is a very significant fact.""

An earlier version of this story mischaracterized a memo that Comey said he asked a friend to leak to a reporter. The memo described Comey's Oval Office meeting with the president on Feb. 14, not his private dinner with the president on Jan. 27.

On Wednesday, congressional Republicans passed their tax cut plan, handing the party and the president a major legislative victory.

The final bill looks a lot like earlier versions from the House and Senate, with minor modifications — for example, it lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, as opposed to the 20 percent in both of the earlier House and Senate bills. In other cases, it finds the middle ground between the two chambers' previous bills — it limits taxpayers to deducting the interest on new mortgages up to $750,000, as opposed to $500,000 in the House bill and $1 million in the Senate bill, which is also the amount set under current law.

Below are two charts showing how individual filers could be affected if this bill is passed and signed into law.

The bar chart shows how the proposed tax brackets look, compared with the brackets under current law. The top rate would fall to 37 percent from 39.6 percent, and fewer households would pay that top rate.

The table below that chart spells out how different provisions in the tax code would affect different groups of Americans.

"Updated 5:30 p.m. ET

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tells NPR that he's sending a letter to Donald Trump Jr., saying that he wants the president's eldest son to testify in an open session of the committee and will subpoena him if necessary.

Grassley first spoke with CNN.

It's the first formal invitation for Trump Jr. to appear before congressional investigators, who want to learn more about his June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

The meeting was also attended by Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Grassley says he wants Trump Jr. to appear ""pretty soon,"" and it could be as early as next week.

Trump Jr. this week released an e-mail exchange which preceded the meeting. In it, he appears willing and eager to accept damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of an effort by the Russian government to help his father's presidential campaign.

In an interview this week with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Trump Jr. downplayed the significance of the meeting, calling it a ""waste of time.""

Congressional investigators clamoring to interview Trump Jr.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is conducting one of several congressional probes focused on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Grassley is the first Republican chairman of a committee leading such an investigation to publicly issue a formal request to meet with Trump Jr.

A spokesman for the Judiciary Committee chairman did not respond to a request for comment about the letter.

Members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees have also said they want to meet with Trump Jr., although neither panel has issued an official request.

Trump Jr. — in his interview with Hannity — said that he is willing to testify under oath about the meeting.

"Donald Trump's first overseas trip as president begins Friday with a pilgrimage of sorts. With stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican, Trump will be visiting the centers of Islam, Judaism and Christianity, the three major monotheistic religions.

But he's wading into deep waters with potential for missteps and disagreement. He'll meet with Muslim leaders despite declaring that ""Islam hates us"" during the campaign; he'll meet with Pope Francis, who advocates for countries to be welcoming to refugees.

""His message is going to be about unity,"" said U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

Just because you stand in a sacred place doesn't mean you hear sacred truths.

Religious differences have produced conflict around the world and especially in the Middle East. Some argue that religion can be part of the solution, if leaders like Trump make stronger faith-based appeals.

""The way we've engaged the world has been strictly in material terms,"" said Robert Nicholson, founder of the Philos Project, which promotes greater religious engagement in the Middle East. ""We think people do things only because of economics or because of some sort of political grievance, but in actuality religion drives huge numbers of people on this planet.""

One cited reason for the failure of the 1993 Oslo Accords to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was that it neglected the importance of religion. A few years later, Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders mounted a peace effort on their own and agreed on a plan. It, too, failed, in part because political leaders failed to lend support to the religious leaders.

""These are huge achievements, but politicians don't seem to want to run with them,"" said Jonathan Sacks, who supported a faith-based peace approach as the chief rabbi of the United Kingdom. ""It's never been connected to a political process. It's been a stand-alone.""

Sacks' book Not in God's Name: Confronting Religious Violence outlined his case that the Abrahamic scriptures support compassion and tolerance rather than hatred and cruelty. He believes that President Trump, by meeting first with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, has an opportunity to make progress where others have failed.

Much of the conversation in the U.S. has been that anything Muslim is bad.

""The president of the United States, through his personal standing, might be able to say, 'Let's make religion part of the peace process,' "" Sacks said, ""because it's the only thing that's been left out of it until now.""

The obstacles in Trump's way are nevertheless daunting. In Saudi Arabia and Israel, Trump will primarily be meeting with political, not religious, leaders.

""Just because you stand in a sacred place doesn't mean you hear sacred truths,"" said Serene Jones, president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York. ""He is obviously picking and choosing [from whom] he is going to hear about these religious traditions. Clearly this is more of a political trip than one of seeking deep religious understanding.""

Another potential problem is that the recent controversies surrounding Trump have so distracted him that he has not been able to prepare adequately for the trip.

""You're wading into deep waters here,"" said Nicholson. ""There are definitely ways Trump can make missteps, either in relating with people from these communities in his private conversations or making public mistakes in terms of what he says.""

Pope Francis is an outspoken advocate of welcoming immigrants and refugees. Given Trump's contrary views, disagreement in those areas could get in the way of a friendly chat in Rome.

In Israel, Trump faces a potential controversy with the question of whether he allows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accompany him on a visit to the Western Wall in Old Jerusalem, claimed by both the Israeli and Palestinian sides.

Trump's biggest challenge is likely to come in Saudi Arabia, where he is scheduled to give a speech urging Muslim leaders to promote ""a peaceful vision of Islam."" Much may depend on how that speech is received, especially given his suggestion during the presidential campaign that ""Islam hates us.""

""He needs to show that he respects Islam [and] that Muslims have dignity,"" said Nicholson. ""For a long time, much of the conversation in the U.S. has been that anything Muslim is bad. I think one of the most important things for him to do is to show that he understands that Muslims have a long and ancient and distinguished past, and that he respects it. I think one of the driving factors in the Islamic world is a feeling that they are not respected.""

The challenges notwithstanding, Nicholson and others are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt on this trip.

""He understands what drives people on the street,"" Nicholson said. ""It's part of his populist genius.""

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia is expelling 755 U.S. diplomats and technical personnel in retaliation against new U.S. sanctions proposed against Moscow.

On Friday, Russia's Foreign Ministry had signaled that the U.S. would need to downsize its staff to 455, to exactly match the number of Russian diplomatic and technical staff in the U.S. Now, Putin has announced the exact number of staff he's ordered the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to cut.

Russia also said Friday that it's seizing two U.S. diplomatic properties, much like the U.S. shut down two Russian diplomatic compounds under the Obama Administration.

In an interview Sunday on Russian TV, Putin said he is opposed to any additional retaliatory actions against the U.S., at least ""as of today,"" Reuters reports.

The new U.S. sanctions against Russia were overwhelmingly approved by Congress earlier this week, with a veto-proof majority. President Trump was initially opposed to the sanctions, but the White House says he is preparing to sign them into law.

As NPR's Miles Parks reported on Tuesday, the sanctions are punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election:

""The legislation slaps Moscow with new financial restrictions on doing business with American entities while also restricting Trump's ability to waive those penalties. Often, a president has a freer hand in dealing with foreign governments, but the bill deliberately takes away that discretion.

""To waive sanctions on Russia, Trump would have to send Congress a report explaining and justifying his decision, and lawmakers would then get 30 days to decide whether to allow it.

""The vote puts Trump in an awkward position. He raised eyebrows from his first days on the campaign trail by expressing a desire to improve the U.S.- Russia relationship. He and his staff have specifically expressed an openness to easing sanctions.

"" 'I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only, is possible, absolutely possible,' Trump said last year at a campaign speech in Washington.""

Speaking in Estonia on Sunday, Vice President Pence criticized Russia's ""destabilizing activities."" But, he said, ""if Russia will change its behavior, our relationship will change for the good.""

"Amid several swirling crises engulfing his administration, President Trump used part of his speech Wednesday to graduates at the United States Coast Guard Academy to complain about how unfairly he was being treated by the media.

""Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted,"" the president told graduates of the military service academy in New London, Conn. ""But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight.""

""Never ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine,"" Trump continued, in what sounded like a pep talk to himself as much as to the graduates.

""Look at the way I've been treated lately, especially by the media,"" the president said as some in the crowd chuckled.

""No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly,"" Trump claimed. ""You can't let them get you down. You can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams.""

The commencement speech marked Trump's first public comments after a bombshell report Tuesday evening that the president had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. That's according to a memo Comey wrote about the encounter, first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed to NPR by two sources close to Comey.

The president was unusually quiet on Twitter on Wednesday morning, his preferred social media method to weigh in on the controversy du jour.

Trump fired Comey last week, and questions continue to swirl about how much that decision was motivated by the FBI's ongoing investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

Trump met last week with Russian officials just one day after he fired Comey, and on Monday, The Washington Post and other news organizations reported that the president had revealed ""highly classified information"" to them reportedly from Israel, a key U.S. ally. Trump defended himself on Twitter Tuesday morning, saying that he had the ""absolute right"" to share information involving ISIS and possible plots to plant bombs in laptops on airlines.

But intelligence experts have warned that such a reveal to the Russians could damage other U.S. relationships in gathering information and that the Russians could have even passed on the information to their ally Iran, which is a major threat to Israel in the Middle East.

The comments to Coast Guard graduates echo ones Trump made at his first commencement address as president this past weekend at Liberty University.

""No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can't be done,"" Trump told graduates at the evangelical school in Lynchburg, Va. ""Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they're people that can't get the job done.""

"Black leaders have condemned the Russian efforts in the 2016 election cycle that apparently sought to divide African-Americans both from whites and from each other, but nothing about those efforts is new.

Russian and Soviet influence-mongers have spent decades pressing as hard as they can on the most painful areas of the American body politic, from the days of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the current era of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Some of the details about the latest chapter in the story have become clear, but much about it remains either unknown or under wraps. Americans may learn more when the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and a Senate Judiciary subcommittee convene a trio of hearings they've scheduled for Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 with three big technology platforms.

Facebook, Google and Twitter — which have said they'll send their top lawyers to testify — have discovered they sold ads to agents of influence as part of the Russian attack on the 2016 election. Agents also used the services to interfere in other ways, from amplifying controversy within the U.S. to organizing real-life events such as political rallies.

""We can't conclusively say these actions impacted the outcome of the election,"" Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an Oct. 10 statement. ""But we can say that these ads caused harm and additional resentment to young people who unselfishly fight for justice and equality for African Americans and other marginalized communities.""

The work, known by intelligence officers as active measures, apparently continues. In the racially charged national debate over mostly black NFL players protesting by kneeling during the national anthem, Twitter accounts linked to the Russian 2016 influence campaign have tried to turn up the volume both on pro-player and anti-player accounts.

Before that, there were the ads on Facebook. And the account called ""Blacktivist"" led calls to action for African-Americans to ""wake up"" and fight ""mass incarceration and death of black men."" And before that, Facebook users using fake accounts paid personal trainers to lead self-defense classes aimed at black activists, arguing that the activists needed to ""protect your rights.""

And before that — the thread goes back decades. Soviet intelligence officers concocted the story that HIV and AIDS were developed by the CIA as a bio-weapon as a way to keep down nonwhites.

In 1984, ahead of the Summer Olympics, Soviet intelligence forged what looked like threatening letters from the Ku Klux Klan to African and Asian nations to try to scare them from sending their teams to the games in Los Angeles. Historian Christopher Andrew and former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin described the scheme in their 1999 book The Sword and the Shield.

""The Olympics — for the whites only,"" the letters said. ""African monkeys! A grand reception awaits you in Los Angeles! We are preparing for the Olympic games by shooting at black moving targets.""

When then-Attorney General William French Smith denounced the messages as Soviet forgeries, Andrew and Mitrokhin write, ""Moscow predictably feigned righteous indication at Washington's anti-Soviet slanders.""

There were many other such Russian schemes, according to now-declassified materials in the public record.

A ""leaked"" presidential memorandum in 1980 yielded this headline in a black newspaper in San Francisco: ""Carter's Secret Plan To Keep Black Africans and Black Americans at Odds,"" Robert Wallace, H. Keith Melton and Henry Robert Schlesinger wrote in their CIA history Spycraft.

In another scheme, Soviet intelligence officers sought to pit black activists in New York against Zionist Jewish groups.

But what makes the targeting of African-Americans especially ugly is that they also have been subject to active measures by their own government.

The FBI under then-Director J. Edgar Hoover ran a campaign to hound King in 1964, including with listening devices in his hotel and letters threatening to ruin him. Meanwhile, the KGB was eager to exploit King as an internal political insurgent against Washington, D.C. When he wouldn't be used that way, the KGB also tried to undermine him.

""King was probably the only prominent American to be the target of active measures by both the FBI and the KGB,"" wrote Andrew and Mitrokhin in The Sword and the Shield.

Distrust endures to this day between black leaders and the FBI. Richmond, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and other members including Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., cited the Bureau's ugly legacy in a recent complaint to the FBI about its investigations into ""black identity extremists.""

""The assessment and the analyses upon which it is based are flawed because it conflates black political activists with dangerous domestic terrorist organizations that pose actual threats to law enforcement,"" they wrote.

""As you are no doubt aware,"" the black lawmakers also wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray, ""the FBI has a troubling history of utilizing its broad investigatory powers to target black citizens ... . Given this history, and given several concerning actions this Administration has taken on racial issues, Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) are justifiably concerned about this FBI Assessment.""

This deep distrust underscores what intelligence officers warned about active measures during the Cold War and continue to see now: Foreign governments don't need to invent controversy in Western democracies. It's already there. What they want is to make the disputes angrier and the debate louder.

Members of Congress and intelligence leaders concluded during the Soviet era that they needed to call out forgeries like the one Smith complained about. And now, some lawmakers also want to mandate more disclosure on the part of digital platforms about the ads they sell. That is expected to be a big focus of the Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 hearings.

Facebook and Twitter want to get out ahead of any action by Congress. The companies have announced on their own that they plan to reveal who buys certain ads, the content of the ads they're running and other information.

Senate Intelligence Committee members, however, have complained that they're not getting all the answers they want from the online platforms, and they've also acknowledged they could uncover more evidence of ads sales or other use by Russian influence-mongers.

One leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, DeRay McKesson, told NPR that about the only thing that has been firmly established so far is how little confidence black or white Americans can have that they're able to see the complete picture.

""This is just a reminder of how we probably don't even know how deep it goes,"" McKesson said.

"For social media editors, the worst nightmare is accidentally posting something personal on the work account.

On Monday night, NPR swing editor Christopher Dean Hopkins lived that nightmare when he posted about Ramona, on NPR's Facebook account:

Twelve minutes later, after realizing his mistake, he edited that post and replaced it with this:

""We don't generally delete posts, so I tried to do it in a way that would be transparent,"" Hopkins says. ""My job is to promote our good work, and I catastrophically failed in that last night.""

But what Hopkins didn't anticipate — and we didn't either — was how much people needed something ""feel good,"" after back-to-back-to-back-to-back tragedies — the Las Vegas massacre and the devastation in Puerto Rico, Florida and the Texas Gulf Coast from hurricanes.

And Ramona — who isn't quite a year old yet — was it.

And there's a petition calling for an updated story about Ramona (you're welcome!) and demanding a small raise (looks at bosses) for Hopkins. At least 250 people were all about this (looks at bosses, again).

The verdict is still out on whether there will be regular Ramona updates.

""I suppose if people keep promising to pledge to NPR and it doesn't distract from the very good work our NPR journalists do, we'll see,"" Hopkins says.

But here's the news everybody really wants to know: Ramona is not a cat! But Ramona does have a cat. You're welcome, Interwebz!

"Updated June 20, 2017, at 2:42 p.m. ET

A lot of people wonder why there is such a focus on the Russia investigations, what Trump's campaign did (or didn't do) and whether there was obstruction of justice.

Below, we laid out the case for why you should care about those items.

And in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 former FBI Director James Comey added his voice again with this observation:

""The reason this is such a big deal. We have this big messy wonderful country where we fight with each other all the time. But nobody tells us what to think, what to fight about, what to vote for except other Americans. And that's wonderful and often painful. But we're talking about a foreign government that using technical intrusion, lots of other methods tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act. That is a big deal. And people need to recognize it. It's not about Republicans or Democrats. They're coming after America, which I hope we all love equally. They want to undermine our credibility in the face the world. They think that this great experiment of ours is a threat to them. So they're going to try to run it down and dirty it up as much as possible. That's what this is about and they will be back. Because we remain — as difficult as we can be with each other, we remain that shining city on the hill. And they don't like it.""

On Wednesday, the underlying actual thing you should care about is getting discussed on Capitol Hill — some of what Russia actually did to meddle in the election and how the U.S. can try to avoid it in the future.

This issue has gotten so steeped in politics, that it's been hard for some in Congress, particularly Republicans, to see the bigger picture.

The marquee testimony will come from Jeh Johnson, the former Homeland Security secretary under President Obama. He testifies before the House Intelligence Committee. Also on Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee hears from outside experts on what exactly they found Russia did.

Here's the original version of this story, which ran May 24:

Some people have FOMO that they might miss an Orlando Bloom waitress update.

Others have a fear of missing out when it comes to the latest on whether Michael Flynn is going to turn over documents that have been requested by Congress — and what's going to happen next in the Russia investigation.

Your author is in the latter category — and doesn't really know how much people care about Orlando Bloom and his waitryst (see what we did there?), but it was a trending Google search.

There is a divide in this country — and it's not the one between Democrats and Republicans. It's the one between people who are deeply captivated by politics and those more engaged with other priorities and ""real"" lives.

At NPR, it's our goal to try and bridge that divide the best we can — to make the complicated understandable and relatable, and especially to tell you why something in politics matters.

That's why a question asked at Tuesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing about the Russia investigation with former Obama CIA Director John Brennan caught our attention:

""Please tell my constituents, my neighbors, why they should care — and not just in Washington, D.C., but in Washington state and Texas and Connecticut and points in between — and why should they care, and why do you care, sir?""

The question was posed by Washington Democrat Denny Heck, and it provoked a high-minded response.

Here's what Brennan said in full:

""Well, for the last 241 years, the nation and the citizens have cherished the freedom and liberty upon which this country was founded upon. Many brave Americans have lost their lives to protect that freedom and liberty and lost their lives to protect the freedom and liberties of other peoples around the world. Our ability to choose our elected leaders, as we see fit, is, I believe, an inalienable right that we must protect with all of the resources and authority and power.

""And the fact that the Russians tried to influence resources and authority and power, and the fact that the Russians tried to influence that election so that the will of the American people was not going to be realized by that election, I find outrageous and something that we need to, with every last ounce of devotion to this country, resist and try to act to prevent further instances of that. And so, therefore, I believe, this is something that's critically important to every American. Certainly, it's very important for me, for my children and grandchildren to make sure that never again will a foreign country try to influence and interfere in the foundation stone of this country, which is electing our democratic leaders.""

Russia is accused, as Brennan said, of not only trying to influence the election by hacking and releasing emails, but engaging in a full-fledged influence campaign through propaganda to get Donald Trump elected. That's the assessment of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Not only that, but the FBI is investigating potential collusion between Trump associates and Russia to help in that effort — in Russia's interest.

Trump's former national security adviser, Flynn, is at the center of all of it. Others, including Trump's former campaign manager for a time, Paul Manafort; Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser; and, the Washington Post reported, a senior adviser currently in the Trump White House, also are being investigated for their ties.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a top adviser, also was found to have met with the head of a Russian state-owned bank and to have communicated with Russian officials. He has offered to speak with the Senate Intelligence Committee.

James Comey was fired as FBI director after testifying twice in the past few months on the FBI's investigation. Wednesday is the deadline set by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz for the FBI to turn over any Comey memos related to the Russia investigation (though it's unclear the Justice Department will allow them to be sent over).

It turns out, Heck also asked Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command, the very same question at a hearing back in March.

Rogers' answer:

""I don't think it's in the best interest of our nation for any external entity to attempt to manipulate outcomes, to shape choices. That should be the inherent role of a democracy. The investigation we're going through, I think, is a positive in the sense it'll help illuminate to all of us, regardless of party, what are the implications here and what does it mean for us, because I think our conclusion, and that of the intelligence community broadly here, is this — absent some change, this behavior is not likely to stop. Absent some change in the dynamic, this is not likely to be the last time we'll be having these discussions about this kind of activity, and I don't think that's in anybody's best interests for us as a nation.""

Regardless of party, Rogers said, as he looked across the dais where plenty of Republicans were seated.

Comey went next and delivered the most consequential answer, given his central role in the investigation. This was the same hearing at which Comey first made public that there was, in fact, an FBI investigation into Trump associates' potential collusion with Russia. The way he ended his answer may have portended his fate (emphasis added):

""Well, like Adm. Rogers, I truly believe we are a shining city on a hill to quote a great American, and one of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair democratic system and the elections that undergird it. And so, when there's an effort by a foreign nation-state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it's very, very serious — threatens what is America. And if any Americans are part of that effort, it's a very serious matter. And so you would expect the FBI to want to understand — is that so? And, if so, who did what? 

""But, again, I want to be very careful, so that people don't overinterpret my words, to preserve our ability to answer those questions, we're not talking about our work. I'm not here voluntarily, right? I would rather not be talking about this at all, but we thought it was important to share at least that much [that there is an FBI investigation into Trump team connections to Russia] with the committee and the American people, and now we're going to close our mouths and do our work to see if we can answer those questions 'cause the answers matter.""

He emphasized that last bit and assuredly shut off his microphone.

""Shining city on a hill,"" of course, is a reference to Ronald Reagan. Comey was a registered Republican until saying last year he no longer was. He served as a prosecutor in the Reagan Justice Department, as well as the ones under Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, and was appointed to positions twice under Republican George W. Bush, including No. 2 at DOJ, before being appointed by Democrat Barack Obama to replace Robert Mueller as head of the FBI.

Trump has derided the Russia investigation as a ""witch hunt,"" essentially declaring it Democratic sour grapes for losing the election. He has tried to reassure Flynn with encouraging notes telling him to ""stay strong,"" per Yahoo.

Trump also seemed to dismiss the concerns of Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, because she was ""somebody who we don't even know,"" he told NBC, as compared to Flynn, whom Trump described as a ""very good person.""

Brennan, Rogers and Comey, who have long, distinguished careers serving under presidents of both parties, all believe asking the questions and getting the answers are important. They should guide decisions for America's future, they said, because the American democracy and its ability to choose its leaders without fear of foreign influence is at the core of the republic.

Many Trump supporters are skeptical and view even any questions asked as attempted indictments.

But these three men would argue that Americans should let the conclusions be guided by the facts and allow a rigorous effort to attain them, because there's nothing more fundamental to a free and fair democracy.

That's why this matters.

"When Donald Trump was running for president, the Kremlin didn't make a secret that it preferred him to Hillary Clinton.

The thinking in Moscow was that Clinton would follow President Obama in trying to diminish Russia's role in the world. Trump, on the other hand, promised not only to be friendlier to Russia, but to turn established U.S. foreign policy on its head.

Now it might seem that Russian President Vladimir Putin's wildest dreams have come true: Trump is in the White House, and the United States is too distracted by internal divisions to throw its weight around internationally.

But while schadenfreude at America's domestic chaos is the prevailing sentiment in Moscow, there's a growing worry that the Kremlin might be getting more than it bargained for.

On Wednesday, Putin reacted to reports that Trump had revealed highly classified material to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

""Initially when we watched the first developments in this internal political struggle, we were amused,"" Putin said. ""But now the spectacle is becoming quite simply sad, and it is causing us concern.""

Putin was so concerned that he even offered to provide Congress with the Kremlin's record of Trump's meeting with Lavrov in the White House earlier this month.

Individual reports about the Kremlin's role in U.S. politics don't reach a wide audience in Russia, says Nikolai Petrov, a political scientist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. But taken as a whole, they project an image of Russia's newfound power.

""The more scandals and rumors connected to Russia, the better it is for Putin to demonstrate how important he is – and how important the country has become under his leadership,"" said Petrov.

Vladimir Frolov, a Russian foreign policy analyst, says Putin's offer to ""help"" Trump by providing a record of the Lavrov meeting was directed at a domestic audience.

""It kind of elevates Putin over Trump – makes him an elder statesman, an experienced guy who can criticize the United States for childish behavior,"" Frolov said.

Still, frustration is increasing that there have been no tangible improvements in U.S.-Russian relations in the first four months of the Trump administration. His fans in Moscow don't blame the U.S. president, but hostile media and Democratic politicians.

""We from Moscow look at Mr. Trump with a lot of sympathy, but we also regret that he has so many enemies which effectively blocked his policy,"" said Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst.

Even though Lavrov's visit to the Oval Office was a success for the Kremlin, there was hope in Moscow that Trump would quickly meet Putin to jumpstart relations.

Foreign affairs analyst Frolov says the Kremlin still thinks it can deal with the U.S. president.

""I think they can manage Trump by flattery, by playing up to his weaknesses, by inflating his ego,"" he said. ""They can manage him, manipulate him. He looks like an easy target.""

Although Putin expressed anger at Trump's missile strike on Russia's ally Syria in April, such unpredictable decisions are less worrying to the Kremlin than if the United States showed a clear strategy to change the Syrian regime, Frolov says.

Yet turmoil in the White House could turn out to be too much of a good thing for the Kremlin.

""It's possible to think that Russia can benefit from this chaos,"" said political scientist Petrov. ""But in the longer term, I think that it's not in Russia's interests as well.""

In the current political climate, it's hard to see Russia and the U.S. reaching an agreement on major issues such as bringing peace to Syria or ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine, a precondition for lifting sanctions on Moscow.

It's positive for Russia that the U.S. is preoccupied with domestic politics, says pro-Kremlin analyst Markov. But at the same time, Russia doesn't want to be demonized in what he calls a ""new McCarthyism"" in the United States.

""Chaos on one hand is good because foreign policy is not so active,"" said Markov. ""On the other hand, it's bad for the future because it can create an absolutely unpredictable foreign policy of the United States.""

A worst-case scenario for the Kremlin would be the tumult in Washington ending with Trump's impeachment – and his replacement by a president openly hostile to Russia.

The Kremlin is waiting for a Putin-Trump meeting – as early as July – to set the course.

During a visit to China last weekend, Putin played a couple of popular Russian songs on a grand piano while waiting for his hosts.

Asked later what he'd play for Trump, Putin scratched his head.

""I don't know,"" he said. ""I think I should meet with him first, discuss things, and choose a tune depending on the results.""

A former Obama official confirms that then-President Barack Obama warned incoming President Donald Trump about Michael Flynn related to his job performance as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Obama and Trump met in the Oval Office shortly after the election in November.

Flynn was fired as head of the DIA during Obama's administration. It has been widely reported that it was over management issues.

Trump named Flynn his national security adviser, but Flynn was forced to resign in February after reports that he spoke with a Russian official about U.S. sanctions and then misled Vice President-elect Mike Pence about the conversations.

News of Obama's warning comes ahead of former Obama Justice official Sally Yates' testimony before a Senate subcommittee at 2:30 p.m. ET on Monday.

General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.

Yates is a key voice when it comes to questions about what — and when — the White House knew about Flynn's conversations with Russian officials. Trump has already been on defense, tweeting Monday morning that Flynn was granted security clearances during the Obama administration, when Flynn headed the DIA.

In Monday's briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, ""It's true that ... President Obama made it known that he wasn't exactly a fan of Gen. Flynn's."" He said that should not be surprising, ""given that Gen. Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings, specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting ISIS and other threats around that were facing America."" Spicer further questioned why, if the Obama administration had concerns about Flynn, it did not revoke Flynn's security clearance.

NPR's Scott Detrow contributed to this report.

The absence of former FBI Director James Comey loomed large over the Senate Intelligence Committee's hearing with top U.S. intelligence leaders, but his temporary replacement, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, assured lawmakers he would not bend to pressure from the White House.

""You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution,"" McCabe said.

McCabe directly contradicted White House assertions that one of the reasons Comey was fired by President Trump on Tuesday was because he had lost the respect and support of the FBI rank and file.

""Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day,"" McCabe said, saying he holds Comey in the ""absolute highest regard.""

McCabe also said the FBI's ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 elections and possible collusion with the Trump campaign was ""highly significant,"" disputing a White House characterization that the investigation ""was one of the smallest things that they've got going on their plate.""

""It is my opinion and belief that the FBI will continue to pursue this investigation vigorously and completely,"" McCabe said.

Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., noted that Comey's absence was atop his mind and that he had plenty of questions for McCabe and the other intelligence leaders about the Russia probe.

""It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the president's decision to remove Director Comey was related to the Russia investigation,"" Warner said, ""and that is truly unacceptable.""

McCabe assured Warner that he would alert the committee if anyone tried to influence the FBI probe into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. He later said he would not update the White House on the ongoing Russia investigation.

Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., made it clear in his opening statement that he wanted the hearing to be about more than just Russia and reiterated that the hearing at large was supposed to be about worldwide threats. But questions about Russia, the ongoing FBI investigation and Comey's dismissal dominated the hearing.

In his own first question to McCabe, Burr asked the acting FBI director about one of the more puzzling and surprising statements in Trump's termination letter to Comey — that the law enforcement chief told the president on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation in regards to Russia.

""Sir, I can't comment on any conversations the director may have had with the president,"" McCabe responded.

He later told Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that it was not standard FBI practice to notify someone if they are not under investigation.

McCabe also told Collins he wasn't familiar with any meeting Comey had with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to request more resources for the Russia investigation. Senate aides have told NPR that Comey met with key members just before he was fired.

""I strongly believe the Russia investigation is adequately resourced,"" McCabe told the lawmakers.

Midway through the hearing, both Burr and Warner excused themselves for a private meeting with Rosenstein. After the meeting, the two committee leaders explained the meeting had been requested prior to Comey's dismissal and that it was to ""set up a process for deconfliction"" between the FBI investigation into Russia and the intelligence committee's own independent probe.

""Regardless of what happens by the Justice Department or by the FBI, the investigation that is done by the Senate Intelligence Committee will continue on its current course as aggressively as we're able to,"" Burr said.

Warner, who noted that he had voted for Rosenstein's confirmation, said he relayed concerns to the deputy attorney general about the timing of Comey's firing and the memo that Rosenstein wrote for the president justifying the termination.

While Trump has continued to cast doubt on the intelligence community's findings that Russia sought to influence the U.S. elections to benefit his campaign, the intelligence leaders were unanimous in their assessment that Russia had indeed interfered with the election.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was unequivocal in his conclusion that there was meddling in his written testimony submitted to the committee:

""Moscow has a highly advanced offensive cyber program, and in recent years, the Kremlin has assumed a more aggressive cyber posture. This aggressiveness was evident in Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 US election, and we assess that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the 2016 US election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets.""

Also joining McCabe and Coats on the panel were: CIA Director Michael Pompeo, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers and the heads of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

"Clouds of ash filled the air around Bali's Mount Agung after the volcano erupted on Saturday and multiple times on Sunday.

Indonesia's National Disaster Management Authority said dark gray clouds reached heights of more than 13,000 feet in the air around the volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island.

""Bali is safe just keep away from disaster prone areas,"" the agency wrote on Twitter.

The government agency warned people within about 4 miles of the volcano to leave. It said ash as thick as half a centimeter was reported in several nearby villages, The Associated Press says, while soldiers and police handed out masks.

""The activity of Mount Agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase, it is still spewing ash at the moment, but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption,"" volconologist Gede Suantika told Reuters. Suantika said the volcano could continue releasing ash for a month but he did not expect a major eruption, according to the AP.

Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation issued their highest ""red"" flight warning, as several flights were canceled on Saturday.

On Sunday, airport authorities told the AP that flights in the area were back to normal.

Mount Agung, which reaches nearly 10,000 feet into the sky and is the highest point in Bali, erupted on Tuesday as well.

About 1,100 people died in the volcano's last major eruption in 1963. In September, more than 140,000 people evacuated following shallow volcanic earthquakes, the wire service says, before the alert was lowered at the end of October. Indonesia has more than 120 active volcanoes.

Bali is a popular destination for tourists, with close to 5 million visitors in 2016, according to the tourism office.

"Updated 12/2, 11:47 a.m. ET

President Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition, and he is cooperating with the special counsel's investigation into Moscow's interference in last year's election.

Flynn told investigators that he was instructed to engage with the Russians by senior members of the Trump transition team.

The plea agreement marks a major development in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe — Flynn is the first former senior official from the Trump White House to face charges. It also suggests that Flynn has information that may take investigators to the core question of their inquiry: possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Speaking Saturday morning before departing for New York City, President Trump again denied any coordination between Russia and his campaign. ""What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion. There's been absolutely no collusion, so we're very happy,"" Trump said when asked about Flynn's guilty plea, according to a pool report.

Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who emerged as a top Trump adviser during the 2016 presidential race, entered his guilty plea during a hearing Friday morning in federal court in Washington, D.C. Leaving the courthouse after about an hour, Flynn stepped into a waiting black SUV and did not answer questions shouted at him by journalists gathered on the sidewalk outside.

But in a statement sent by his lawyers, Flynn admitted that he has made mistakes.

""I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,"" he said. ""My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.""

The single count relates to Flynn's discussions in late 2016 — during the transition period between Trump's victory on Election Day and his inauguration in late January — with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia and about a U.N. Security Council resolution, according to court papers filed by the special counsel.

Other court papers released Friday provide more details on those interactions.

The day after then-President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia over Moscow's election interference, Flynn spoke with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the court documents say.

Flynn first consulted with a ""senior official of the Presidential Transition Team,"" who was with other transition members at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, on what to tell the ambassador about American sanctions.

Speaking later that day with Kislyak, Flynn requested that Russia not retaliate against the punitive measures just imposed by the U.S., the court papers say. Flynn then called the transition official to report on his discussion. The following day, Russia announced that it would not take retaliatory measures against the U.S.

Top Trump aides Stephen Miller, K.T. McFarland, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus were all at Mar-a-Lago with then-President-elect Trump on Dec. 29, 2016, according to a pool report by a journalist assigned to cover Trump and the transition team on that day.

Flynn also engaged in a similar back-and-forth with the Russian ambassador over a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The incoming Trump administration opposed the resolution, and Flynn asked the Russian envoy to either oppose the measure or delay it. Flynn was directed by a ""very senior member"" of the transition team to make the request, court papers say.

Media reports have suggested that ""very senior"" transition official is Jared Kushner. A person familiar with the Trump transition efforts denies that Kushner ""directed"" Flynn to contact officials from Russia and other foreign governments to find out their stance on the resolution.

""The U.N. effort was well-known and a collaborative effort by Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, General Flynn and Jared Kushner,"" the source told NPR. ""None of them 'ordered' or 'directed' the others and all were working towards the same goal.""

Flynn resigned from his White House post under pressure in February after allegations that he discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, then misled Vice President Pence about the conversations.

""Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States,"" Flynn wrote in his resignation letter.

After Flynn's departure, he went out of his way to express loyalty to the president and he told acquaintances he was still in touch with Trump, who urged him to ""stay strong,"" according to a Yahoo News report.

On Friday, White House special counsel Ty Cobb tried to distance the administration from Flynn, describing him as ""a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump administration, and a former Obama administration official.""

Cobb said that Flynn's false statements ""mirror"" those he made to White House officials, which resulted in his resignation in February.

""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,"" Cobb added. ""The conclusion of the Special Counsel's work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.""

But Flynn's plea agreement and cooperation with Mueller would seem to signal the opposite — that the investigation has now reached into the Trump White House itself, and that it still has a long way to go before wrapping up.

Flynn was a trusted adviser who worked closely with other campaign officials, many of whom are now senior administration officials.

Flynn has long been known to face legal troubles over a range of issues.

Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover, testified under oath on Capitol Hill that she had warned the White House counsel about Flynn before her firing in January, but that he seemed to play down the significance of her warning.

Flynn also took the step of filing documents with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, for his lucrative lobbying work on behalf of Turkey in 2016, a period that overlapped with the presidential campaign. Criminal enforcement of the FARA has been spotty, with only seven cases since 1966.

But failure to register under the law formed the basis of criminal charges against Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, and Manafort's deputy, Richard Gates, in late October.

As investigations into Russian election interference began to intensify this year, Flynn offered to testify to congressional committees — if he could receive immunity in exchange for his remarks. ""Gen. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,"" his lawyer Robert Kelner said at the time.

More recently, Flynn's son, Michael G. Flynn, who worked alongside his father at the Flynn Intel Group, has come under scrutiny from congressional investigators and the special counsel.

Several veteran lawyers on the special counsel team have a history of approaching lower-level figures, including relatives of their targets, to build bigger cases against corporate executives or mob figures.

After prosecutors unveiled charges against Manafort and Gates on Oct. 30, the White House distanced itself from them, pointing out that the bulk of their alleged offenses predated the presidential campaign.

But putting distance between Trump and Flynn may be more of a challenge, as the president repeatedly praised Flynn for his service and loyalty, even after he left the White House this year.

"Updated at 11:05 a.m. ET

Ordinary people often get into legal trouble in response to desperate circumstances. Politicians, however, seem to make the worst trouble for themselves when they are riding high and carrying all before them.

Thus the most famous political scandals of U.S. history have happened not when presidents or members of Congress had their backs to the wall but when their sails were filled with a favorable wind.

In earlier generations we have seen presidents from Warren Harding in the 1920s to Richard Nixon in the 1970s, Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and Bill Clinton in the 1990s beset by scandal — all at the apex of their political clout and acclaim.

What these cases have in common is the sense that these presidents (and the people around them) perceived in their success a special dispensation. They regarded themselves as above it all, exempt from the rules.

A familiar scenario returns to Washington

We are reminded of this now because echoes of the past have been audible in the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday.

Comey sketched the scope of the alleged Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the U.S.

He also said he had been fired by President Trump over his handling of the FBI investigation of that interference and possible connections to the Russians among the Trump campaign's inner circle.

With the appointment of Comey's FBI predecessor, Robert Mueller, as a special counsel to investigate the Russian interference and its relation to Trump World, we are entering a new phase of this story. Remarkably, it appears the Trump White House continues to regard it all as political badinage more than an actual legal exposure with enormous implications.

And in that sense, they share an attitude with other administrations that have suffered from a myopia about their own vulnerability — and suffered for it as well.

The stage is set

Late last year, having won a presidential election few expected them to win, Trump and Company had the political world at their feet. Republicans as divergent as Mitt Romney and Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan were willing to forget their past rivalry, criticism and opposition to be part of a new future — in service to the new leader of the party and the nation.

But in this sunburst of success, the transition team around the then president-elect seems to have been blind to what was looming on the horizon — a threat born of the campaign's own relationships with elements of the Russian government.

In his testimony this week, Comey spoke of cyberattacks on ""perhaps more than a thousand"" different entities and agencies in and out of government. He called it an effort to tell Americans ""what to think and what to fight about,"" and ""a big deal.""

But the response of Trump and his entourage has been all along to cast doubt on the existence of the attacks, doubt on the Russian role and doubt on the motives of those who, like Comey, saw something nefarious afoot. It was, said the president, all an excuse for the disappointing showing by the Democrats at the ballot box, a line he has repeated even into the spring.

Mueller is now beginning his investigation with a heavyweight staff and a meaningful mandate. Committees in Congress will also continue taking testimony. Much of all this will take place in private. Time will pass before we know the full extent of their findings.

But this much is clear: something the Trump team might have dealt with expeditiously as recently as six months ago has grown to cast a shadow on the White House and the prospects for the president's agenda.

In that sense, the early stumbles of the new administration remind us of previous rough patches for predecessors. Other administrations also missed the chance to cut their losses at the first sign of scandal, and they did so in part because trouble struck when they were at a moment of maximum power and expectation.

On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said President Trump's only problem was ""he's new at this."" Trump, 70, has been called many things over the years, but rarely ""naïve."" It is more likely the president-elect of late 2016 and early 2017 considered himself to be bulletproof.

Lessons to be learned

What we have seen in the past is that the Oval Office can quickly become a low-altitude version of Olympus from which policy decisions and appointments are handed down. This attitude takes hold during the first transition into office and often reaches an apogee after re-election. (If that is true, it is a challenge to imagine what a second Trump transition period might look like.)

In the hubris of the moment, having vanquished the world of electoral politics, a new or re-elected administration is fully confident of its mandate, and equally full of itself. In such a moment, when that first bad story comes down the pike, the first impulse in the White House is to will it away or eradicate it by any means necessary.

And in their resolve to rid themselves of the problem in this way, they make mistakes that less cocksure people would be less likely to make. To wit: denying the story or the problem even exists, moving to quash all evidence to the contrary and to remove all those who disagree (and, as a rule, to denounce the media).

What may begin as a relatively minor matter of limited and temporal consequence morphs into a disaster. Underlings and intermediaries lose their jobs and sometimes go to jail. And once in a while, the destruction even reaches the top of the pyramid.

The paramount example is, of course, Watergate, which ultimately forced Nixon to resign. It began even as Nixon was sweeping to a 49-state landslide re-election in 1972. When the burglars were arrested at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, the question for those who sent them became whether to pay hush money. Then the sources of the money had to be hidden, and so on.

Lies were piled upon lies. It all led back to the president himself, and there turned out to be incriminating conversations preserved on tape. In the end, Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.

After their own re-elections, Reagan and Clinton both saw their second terms in office nearly derailed by scandals that could have been smothered far sooner with a bit of foresight and the proper resolve.

In Reagan's case it was an effort to free hostages held by a terrorist group in Lebanon by selling arms to their allies in Iran and then using the proceeds to finance anti-communist insurgents in Central America.

Known as the Iran-Contra scandal, it was rather legalistic and devolved to a partisan hearing on Capitol Hill that allowed for dramatic defenses by some of the accused. The public was interested, some were exercised, but Reagan himself was well-insulated. No one went to jail but one fellow was caught in the backwash and found to have evaded some taxes.

The public was also rather ambivalent about the main scandal of the Clinton years, his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and subsequent perjury in denying it.

The affair came to light after Clinton's surprisingly easy re-election. Clinton had been unwilling to settle a sexual harrassment lawsuit in the mid-1990s filed by an Arkansas woman named Paula Jones and that suit became the platform on which Lewinsky was introduced to the nation.

The result was impeachment and a grinding, debilitating trial in the Senate, which failed to result in even a majority for conviction, let alone the required two-thirds.

The illusion of invincibility blinded these presidents and their inner circles in the critical moments when an infection was becoming a systemic threat to life. In those moments, they reacted with arrogance to what they saw as an embarrassment or a distraction with political implications. They made a fire in a garage into a five-alarm catastrophe that shattered careers, sent officials to jail and turned the trajectory of a presidency to the worse.

It is not a history anyone wants to see repeated.

Republicans pummeled the FBI and Justice Department on Wednesday as they continued painting its special counsel, Robert Mueller, as the boss of a partisan fishing expedition rife with Democratic sympathizers that is out to get President Trump.

But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted the fishing expedition narrative and told the House Judiciary Committee that Mueller is not off inside a locked room hidden from his view, but instead is consulting with him about the directions his team wants to travel.

""I know what he's doing,"" Rosenstein said. ""If I felt he was doing something inappropriate, I would take action.""

The deputy attorney general also reminded the committee that he retains the authority to fire Mueller if he sees fit — but only for what he said is ""good cause."" Asked what he would do if Trump ordered him to fire Mueller, Rosenstein said he would evaluate that question on its merits.

""If there were good cause, I would act. If there were no good cause, I would not.""

Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., cited hundreds of text messages between two FBI agents who reacted to political events last year with contempt for then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and support for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

One senior special agent, who was a part of the Clinton email server investigation and then became part of the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and its potential ties to Russia, was removed from Mueller's team.

The two FBI employees ""clearly let their strong political opinions cloud their professional judgment,"" Goodlatte charged. But that isn't all, he said; the presence of attorneys who have given campaign contributions to Democrats or made comments critical of the president meant the Mueller team has begun to ""look more and more partisan.""

Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, read what he said was an alphabetical list of campaign donations from people on Mueller's investigative team — one he said heavily favored Democrats.

Justice Department employees are permitted to make such contributions and to express their political views, which are barred by the department's official rules from being considered in evaluating their work.

But that is ridiculous, critics charge.

""How, with a straight face, can you say this group of Democrat partisans are unbiased and will give President Trump a fair shake?"" Chabot asked. ""I would submit the Mueller team ought to be attired with Democratic donkeys or 'I'm with Hillary' T-shirts ... and I think it's really sad.""

Rosenstein defended the Justice Department and the FBI, as the bureau's director, Christopher Wray, did at a similar hearing last week.

The Justice Department is evaluating whether to appoint a second special counsel to look into some of the matters raised by Republicans, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said. But neither Sessions nor Rosenstein have given a strong sense about what they might ultimately decide.

Wray told the House Judiciary Committee last week that the Justice Department already is doing an outside investigation into the handling of the case of Clinton's private email server while she was secretary of state. Its inspector general's office, doing that work, uncovered the text messages that Goodlatte cited, Rosenstein said.

Rosenstein told members of Congress on Wednesday to let that process move ahead before he and they decide what action to take, if any. The findings would be ready ""in the next couple of months,"" he said.

The anti-Trump text messages, and other examples of what Republicans call bias, have fueled a coordinated campaign by Republicans to try to damage Mueller and his office as much as possible.

Personal lawyers for Trump also have gone on offense, charging the Justice Department and the FBI with bias and calling for another special counsel.

The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, said Republicans are threatening to go beyond normal partisanship and seriously damage respect for the Justice Department and the rule of law. How much worse might it get, he asked, if Mueller brings more indictments against people in the Trump orbit?

""I understand the instinct to want to cover to the president,"" Nadler said. ""I'm fearful that the majority's effort to turn the tables on the special counsel will get louder and more frantic as the walls continue to close in around the president.""

Other Democrats pressed Rosenstein about his commitment to follow the law and proper procedure in case of pressure to fire Mueller. The rising temperature of the criticism from Republicans and the heavy focus of the charges of bias have prompted Mueller supporters to worry that Trump again may be considering removing him.

""I am not going to be discussing my communications with the president, but nobody has communicated to me the desire to remove Robert Mueller,"" Rosenstein said.

He did acknowledge that he talks with Trump frequently in the course of his Justice Department duties, but in response to questions from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., Rosenstein said he had never spoken with Trump in a one-on-one meeting.

Former FBI Director James Comey had said that Trump used such meetings to ask him for his personal loyalty and, later, to lay off of the FBI investigation of former national security adviser Mike Flynn.

Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI; Trump has denied all along that he ever asked Comey for such a pledge or to go easy on Flynn.

But Swalwell told Rosenstein that it's because Americans can't know exactly what goes on behind closed doors in Washington, D.C., that he must commit to resist pressure to get rid of Mueller.

""We need you to be fearless,"" he said.

"Updated: 5:13 p.m.

The vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee accused Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday of ordering a ""deliberate campaign carefully constructed to undermine"" last year's presidential election.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., made the charge as the Senate panel held a rare public hearing about Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. In his opening statement, Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., avoided any mention of last year's presidential campaign, but said efforts by Russia to ""discredit the United States and weaken the West are not new.""

But the biggest revelation in Thursday's hearing was the disclosure of two new high-profile targets of Russian cyber efforts: House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio said that his presidential campaign was targeted last July, and he said, within the last 24 hours a second attempt was made against former members of his campaign staff. Rubio said both attacks were traced to a Russian IP address, and that neither attack was successful.

The attack against Ryan was revealed by Clint Watts, a cyber expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute Program on National Security. Watts testified social media campaigns targeted Ryan ""hoping to foment further unrest amongst U.S. democratic institutions."" Watts told reporters that other GOP presidential campaigns had also been targeted.

He also said that Russian ""gray outlets"" or fake accounts tweet at President Trump ""at high volumes when they know he is online, pushing conspiracy theories,"" in hopes he will repeat them.

Watts also said that Russian ""active measures"" to sow disinformation in the 2016 campaign worked because Trump sowed his own disinformation during the presidential race about opponents, alleged voter fraud and persistent concerns that the election was being rigged. ""Part of the reason active measures work,"" Watt said, mentioning Trump's recent unsubstantiated claim that Trump Tower had been wiretapped at the direction of President Obama, ""is that they parrot the same lines.""

Another witness, retired Gen. Keith Alexander, a former head of the National Security Agency and of the U.S. Cyber Command, said the Trump administration needs to ""cool this down,"" referring to the Russian cyber attacks aimed at the U.S. and its allies.

He said the U.S. needs to let Russia know ""what things they can't do and why they cannot do those,"" and called on the committee to address the issue in a bipartisan approach, ""for the good of the nation.""

Putin on Thursday again dismissed charges that he sought to disrupt the U.S. election as ""endless and groundless.""

At a news conference Wednesday, Burr and Warner pledged ""to go wherever the intelligence leads us,"" in Burr's words, in their investigation. Their posture stands in stark contrast to the House Intelligence Committee probe, which has stalled after Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., reported he viewed intelligence documents on the White House grounds which he then briefed President Trump about, but refused to share with other committee members.

Democrats have called on Nunes, who also served on the Trump transition team, to recuse himself, but Nunes has said he sees no reason to do so.

The New York Times reported the identities Thursday of two White House staffers the newspaper said had helped give Nunes the intelligence reports the California lawmaker then used to brief Trump. NPR has not confirmed that report and at Thursday's press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer would not confirm the newspaper's report.

Spicer did, however, say Thursday that the White House has invited the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to review documents it says are related to ""whether information collected on U.S. persons was mishandled or leaked."" Spicer wouldn't say exactly what the information was but said it was found by national security staff ""in the ordinary course of business."" He also said the information was relevant to a letter earlier this month from Nunes asking the intelligence community for any such information.

The FBI is also conducting an investigation.

Warner said the Senate panel will look into reports that ""there were upwards of 1,000 paid Internet trolls"" in Russia that might have sent fake news stories targeted in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

"Tesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juan's Hospital del Niño (Children's Hospital), in what company founder Elon Musk calls ""the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.""

The project came about after Puerto Rico was hit by two devastating and powerful hurricanes in September, and Musk reached out about Tesla helping.

Musk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, ""Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities.""

Tesla's image of the project's solar array, in a parking lot next to the hospital, has been liked more than 84,000 times since it was posted to Instagram Tuesday.

Hospital del Niño is first of many solar+storage projects going live. Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello pic.twitter.com/JfAu11UBYg

Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that some of his company's work is being rerouted so it could ""increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.""

The hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs, according to El Nuevo Dia. The facility has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions; it also offers services to some 3,000 young patients, the newspaper says. As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells Nuevo Dia that for now, it's a donation — and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent.

Both Rossello and the tech company tweeted about the project this week, with Tesla saying in a post, ""Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello"" — and Rossello stating, ""A major contribution of @Tesla to the Hospital del Niño.""

The news of restoring permanent power at the hospital comes as millions of people in Puerto Rico continue to rely on generators for electricity. As of Wednesday morning, the Electric Power Authority reported that its power service was at 25 percent.

The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid is expected to take months and to cost as much as $5 billion.

Last week, the territory's electric and power authority signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a small and relatively young Montana company, to restore the power grid. The deal has sparked scrutiny and skepticism, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley and Nicky Ouellet of Montana Public Radio reported.

Tesla isn't the only tech company trying to help Puerto Rico; Google's parent company, Alphabet, has deployed balloons from its Project Loon to the territory, to help parts of the island reconnect after much of its phone system went down. The portable network can help phone users with both messaging and some web browsing.

"Updated at 9:25 p.m. ET

President Trump suggested on Twitter Friday morning there might be recordings of his private conversations with former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired earlier this week, in an apparent attempt to caution Comey against ""leaking to the press.""

At the White House briefing in the afternoon, press secretary Sean Spicer refused multiple times to confirm or deny whether there is a secret recording device in the Oval Office.

""I've talked to the president, and the president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer said, adding his oft-used statement that ""the tweet speaks for itself.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

Asked whether the White House has a recording of Comey's conversations with the president, Spicer said, ""I am not aware of that."" He also denied the tweet was a ""threat,"" saying instead that the president had ""simply stated a fact.""

Officials to interview candidates for FBI director

A source familiar with the process tells NPR, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will interview four candidates for the FBI director job Saturday. NPR has been told these interviews are not exhaustive and are just the start of the process.

The source says those being interviewed Saturday are:

A week of contradictions from the White House

Friday's suggestion from the president caps a chaotic week for the White House, which has struggled to control the fallout after Comey's abrupt termination.

The presidential tweet appeared to be a response to news stories since the Tuesday firing, which have contradicted the White House's initial version of the events surrounding Comey's dismissal.

But in an NBC News interview on Thursday, it was Trump himself who said he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Justice Department's recommendation — even though White House staff and even Vice President Pence had pointed to the recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier in the week as the impetus for Trump's decision.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced Friday afternoon that Rosenstein has agreed to brief the full Senate next week in a closed-door session about Comey's dismissal and the FBI's Russia investigation.

Multiple outlets have reported that Trump asked Comey for his loyalty at a private dinner in January but that the then-FBI director ""declined to make that pledge,"" The New York Times reported.

Spicer denied that Trump had asked Comey to pledge his loyalty during that dinner.

In an interview set to air Saturday night with Fox News' Jeanine Pirro, Trump said he didn't ask Comey for his loyalty but he didn't think it ""would be a bad question to ask"" and wasn't an inappropriate inquiry to the head of the FBI.

On MSNBC Friday afternoon, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Andrea Mitchell that Comey had told him he was having dinner at the White House that evening in January and that he was ""uneasy"" over the invitation from Trump.

Congressional Democrats want ""tapes"" — and answers

The Senate Intelligence Committee had asked Comey to testify before it next Tuesday, but ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va., told MSNBC Friday that the former FBI director declined, although ""it is our hope in the not too distant future that we can find a time for him to come in and talk to our committee.""

""I believe at the appropriate time and place [Comey] is going to tell his side of the story, and my hope is that that place at least will be in front of our committee,"" Warner said.

It's unclear whether the ""tapes"" Trump alluded to in his tweet would be audio or video recordings, or whether they exist at all. As The Washington Post pointed out, the president used a similar construction in his unsubstantiated wiretapping accusations against former President Barack Obama.

Soon after Trump's tweets, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., requested that White House Counsel Donald McGahn turn over any recordings of the president's conversations with Comey to the House Oversight Committee. Krishnamoorthi also asked for any recording of Trump's Wednesday meeting with Russian officials and ""any conversations regarding the hiring or firing"" of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""These White House tapes could accelerate current investigations as previous tapes have aided past inquiries,"" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement.

House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers, D-Mich., also sent McGahn a letter requesting any tapes or communications between Trump and Comey. The two also said they believed Trump may have intimidated a potential witness with his tweet, which is a federal crime.

""The President's actions this morning—as well as his admission yesterday on national television that he fired Director Comey because he was investigating Trump campaign officials and their connections to the Russian government—raise the specter of possible intimidation and obstruction of justice,"" Cummings and Conyers wrote in the letter. ""The President's actions also risk undermining the ongoing criminal and counter-intelligence investigations and the independence of federal law enforcement agencies.""

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also issued a blistering statement on Trump's tweets, calling on the president to ""immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading — and in this case threatening — statement.""

Clapper pushes back against Trump's claims on Russia investigation

Trump also tweeted Friday morning that Clapper had testified there was no evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia — which the president deemed a ""witch hunt.""

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?

On Monday, Clapper testified in a hearing on Russian election interference held by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that he wasn't aware of any evidence of collusion and hadn't even been aware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey revealed it during a House hearing in March.

But Clapper later clarified to MSNBC that as DNI during the Obama administration he let FBI investigations operate independently and that such knowledge would be outside his scope.

""It is not surprising or ... abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation, or even more importantly, the content of that investigation,"" Clapper said. ""So I don't know if there was collusion or not. I don't know if there was evidence of collusion or not. Nor should I have in this particular context.""

Trump threatens to ax White House press briefings

In his Friday morning tweetstorm, the president also suggested that his administration could do away with briefings for the press and instead give out written statements.

...Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???

Trump added that ""as a very active president with lots of things happening,"" it's impossible for him to stay in such close communication with his staff that the briefings would be completely accurate.

Schiff took issue with that as well. ""Finally, and with respect to the President's suggestion that as a very busy person, he doesn't have time to ensure that his spokespeople are accurately portraying his actions — it is difficult to know how to respond — except to say, being truthful with the American people is a core responsibility of the job,"" Schiff said. ""If he did not want to willingly undertake even the minimal requirements of the Presidency, it would have been far better for him to have considered that before he chose to run for the highest office in the land.""

Spicer also didn't knock down the idea that press briefings in the future may be curtailed, saying that the president was dismayed over the press's attempts to ""parse every little word and make it more of a game of 'gotcha.' ""

Trump reiterated in his interview with Fox News' Pirro that he believes ending the briefings would be a good idea.

""Unless I have them every two weeks and do it myself, we won't have them. I think it's a good idea,"" the president said.

White House Correspondents' Association President Jeff Mason, a Reuters journalist, reiterated in a statement that canceling briefings would be an affront to the ""constitutionally-protected principles"" of a free press.

""White House briefings and press conferences provide substantive and symbolic opportunities for journalists to pose questions to officials at the highest levels of the U.S. government. That exercise, conducted in full view of our republic's citizens, is clearly in line with the spirit of the First Amendment,"" Mason said. ""Doing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

NPR's Geoff Bennett and Susan Davis contributed to this report.

"Back in October, before his election, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump laid out a 100-Day Action Plan. He called it his ""Contract With The American Voter."" Among other things, it called for the full repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, suspension of immigration from certain ""terror-prone regions"" and the lifting of ""roadblocks"" to let ""infrastructure projects like the Keystone Pipeline move forward.""

The 100-day mark is not an official milestone, but in roughly the last century it has been a traditional point to take stock of a new administration. Throughout President Trump's first 100 days, there have been both flurries of action and some setbacks. In many cases, the status of some of these efforts is not clear-cut — often with substantial talk but less action. In other areas, progress is clearer.

Saturday, April 29, marks the 100th day of Trump's term and NPR is revisiting his action plan, through annotations from journalists throughout the newsroom, and taking stock of how the president's accomplishments compare with the goals he set for himself for the same period.

"Steve Inskeep talks to Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent, aligned with Democrats and a member of the intelligence committee, about the resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 

In the space of hours, the White House made a statement about President Trump and Russia, and then new information contradicted it. First, let's hear the denial from White House spokesman Sean Spicer, questioned here by ABC's Jonathan Karl.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

JONATHAN KARL: Back in January, the president said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians. Now today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election?

SEAN SPICER: My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period - well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador.

KARL: I'm talking about during the campaign.

SPICER: I don't have any - I - there's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.

INSKEEP: So nothing has changed, he said. And then hours later, a New York Times report was headlined ""Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence."" That report cites U.S. intercepts of communications said to be between Trump aides and senior Russian intelligence officials. And at least one of those aides, Paul Manafort, has refuted the allegations. He said he did not knowingly have any contact. The many voices we're hearing this morning include Senator Angus King of Maine, who's an independent aligned with Democrats and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Senator, thanks for coming by our studios.

ANGUS KING: Absolutely, Steve. Glad to be here.

INSKEEP: What do you want to know about this?

KING: Everything - the short word is everything. First, we want to know the extent of what the Russians did, how they did it. And this is consistent with what the Russians have been doing around the world. It's not surprising in terms of the hacking, the disinformation and all of that. But the questions that have arisen in the last few days have been, from the beginning, a part of the investigation that our committee's going to conduct. And that is, were there contacts between either of the campaigns, in this case the Trump campaign, and the Russians?

And that's a very important part of this story.

INSKEEP: Slightly different - very important difference, though - question, were there contacts? The New York Times says, yes, citing intelligence sources. But then the other question is, was there collusion? And here, The New York Times says, according to their sources, so far, no. Do you have any different information?

KING: I do not. And that's exactly where we're going to begin. We had a meeting yesterday discussing where the investigation's going to go. We'll be talking to Michael Flynn. We've identified a number of people that we need to talk to, a large trove of documents that we're going to be looking at. But we have to get to the bottom of this. And I think it's important. The Intelligence Committee usually does its work in secret because of trying to protect sources and methods. We don't want to betray how we're getting the information.

On the other hand, I'm going to be pushing for as much public discussion of this as possible because one of the things that has to come out of this is the American people need to know how the Russians are trying to play this game. One of our defenses is if the people know this is standard Russian technique. I met with people from Eastern Europe. I said, how do you defend yourself because the Russians are doing this all the time?

They said, because our public knows it's happening. And they say, oh, that's just the Russians. We need to get to that point. And that's why this investigation has to be as public as possible given our responsibility to protect sources and methods of gaining intelligence.

INSKEEP: We're talking with Angus King, senator, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. And you gave us some interesting information just now, Senator. You said you're going to be talking with Michael Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned this week after saying that he'd given incomplete information, his phrase, about phone calls with the Russian ambassador. That was after the election. What are your questions for Michael Flynn?

KING: Well, one of the questions is, what was in those conversations? But one of the questions is, were there contacts before the election? He was involved in the campaign from the beginning. He has a bit of a history with Russia in the sense of having been a commentator for Russian television. One of my questions is, was he paid when he worked for Russian television? He was at a - just about a year ago, a little over a year ago, he was at a banquet sitting right next to Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

What's that relationship all about? What was the relationship during the campaign and subsequently? And, of course, some questions - the White House yesterday characterized his interactions with the Russian ambassador as kind of routine, pre-transition. If that was the case, why did he mislead the vice president? Why was it hidden and covered up until it finally came out in the last few days?

INSKEEP: Now, we've heard other voices on the program today about this, one of them Republican Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who's on the House Judiciary Committee. And he is raising a different concern. His concern, he says, is not what Mike Flynn did or didn't do but the leaks, the fact that we're finding out about this. And it is true. We're sitting here discussing sensitive - extremely sensitive communications intercepts by the United States government.

Is this something that should not really be discussed in public?

KING: We have to discuss the subject matter of it, the substance of it. I think the leaks is a legitimate issue. It's one that needs to be examined because it is disturbing when this information is released publicly. On the other hand, we don't know where it came from. We know that the White House knew about this for the last two and a half weeks, and the Justice Department knew about it and the intelligence community. So this White House hasn't exactly been famous for being hermetically sealed over the last couple of weeks.

Some of these leaks may have come out of the White House itself. We don't know that. I consider the leak investigation as significant and one that should be on its own track. But I see that as separate from the underlying investigation of the substantive issue of Russian attempts to influence the American election and whether one of the campaigns was in contact with the Russians during this period. This is something that's never happened in American history. This is very, very, gravely serious stuff.

And, yes, the leaks are important, but that shouldn't be used as a diversion to say, wait a minute, we're not going to talk about what came out here.

INSKEEP: We also asked Congressman Johnson about Democratic concerns that a Republican-controlled Congress was not really holding oversight, meaningful oversight, over a Republican president. Rand Paul, senator from Kentucky, said last night that he didn't think Republicans should spend so much time investigating Republicans. But there you are, Senator King, on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has said on a bipartisan basis it's going to investigate. Are you?

KING: Yes, and as I say, I think the Republicans on the committee - I know them well. I've sat in that same room with them for four years. And I think they're serious about this. Chairman Burr is serious about it. And they're also...

INSKEEP: Richard Burr of North Carolina.

KING: Richard Burr, he's the Republican chair. It's a committee that's very carefully balanced. It's 8 to 7. And generally, we act in a nonpartisan basis - not always, there've been cases. The torture report, unfortunately, turned into a partisan issue. We're going to be working very hard to see that that doesn't happen this time. And everybody - we had a long meeting talking about it yesterday. And we're going to follow the evidence where it goes.

And I understand that there are calls for an independent commission and those kinds of things. The problem with that is, as I see it - and I understand the impulse for that - is they - it would take them months to get where we already are in terms of identifying documents, identifying people, working with the agencies we have. We work with the intelligence agencies historically. So I understand that concern. I can tell you one thing. I'm not going to be part of any kind of cover-up or whitewash or anything else.

This is probably the most important work I've ever done in my life. And I'm going to take it seriously. And it's - I'm going to be a real loud problem if I see any evidence of trying to avoid digging into this.

INSKEEP: Just a couple of seconds left here. It's been weeks since the committee announced its investigation. Are you already making progress?

KING: Yes. We've identified staff who are working on it. We've been in touch with the agencies. We're now working out things like where the documents will be and those kinds of things. Yes, we're moving forward.

INSKEEP: Senator Angus King of Maine, thanks for coming by, really appreciate it.

KING: Thank you.

"William Browder knows Vladimir Putin's Russia all too well.

Browder made a fortune in Russia, in the process uncovering, he says, incredible amounts of fraud and corruption. When he tried to report it to authorities, the government kicked him out of the country and, he alleges, tortured and killed the lawyer he was working with.

In what one senator called one of the Senate Judiciary Committee's ""most important"" hearings, Browder, a wealthy businessman-turned-activist-turned Putin-adversary shed a chilling new light on a Russian system of government that operates ruthlessly in the shadows — as Browder described it for lawmakers: a ""kleptocracy"" sustained by corruption, blackmail, torture and murder with Putin at its center.

""Effectively the moment that you enter into their world,"" Browder told senators investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, ""you become theirs.""

""No good guys""

Browder's story — how he ended up living in London, after almost a decade of vast success as a businessman in Moscow, is arguably a case study in how Putin's government works: a system of intermediary influential businessmen who aren't directly employed by the Russian government, but who benefit financially from Putin's regime.

Browder founded and ran one of the largest investment firms in Russia, Hermitage Capital Management, from 1996-2005. When he and his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky discovered a massive corruption scheme, they went to the authorities.

""And we waited for the good guys to get the bad guys,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It turned out that in Putin's Russia, there are no good guys.""

After making their complaint, Browder was accused of tax evasion; he alleges the $230 million he thought his business was paying in taxes to the Russian Treasury was misappropriated and funneled to those in power, at once making him a criminal and making Putin's circle richer.

He was denied access back into the country after an international trip, but Magnitsky wasn't so lucky. Browder told the senators the Russian lawyer was detained by the authorities, denied medical treatment for pancreatitis while he was jailed, and then allegedly beaten to death in 2009 while chained to a prison cell bed.

Putin has continuously denied the allegations regarding Magnitsky.

""Investigators concluded that there was no malicious intent, or criminal negligence in Magnitsky's death. It was just a tragedy,"" Putin said in 2013, in an interview with a Russian television station. ""One might think no deaths occur in U.S. prisons.""

Human rights groups, however, have agreed with Browder's telling of events.

After advocacy by Browder, in 2012, Congress passed the Magnitsky Act. The law targets Russian human rights abusers by freezing their American assets and banning them from entering the U.S. The bill was named after the deceased Russian lawyer who had fought corruption in the country alongside Browder.

Reverberations

Putin has spent the last half decade fighting through various methods to undermine and ultimately repeal the eponymous law. In addition, as retaliation for the law, he imposed a policy in Russia — what Browder called ""the most sadistic thing he could do"" — banning the adoption of sick and disabled Russian children by American families.

Much of Thursday's hearing was spent getting at the bigger question: Why is the Russian president so fixated on the Magnitsky Act?

There are two reasons, according to Browder:

""This is a war of ideology between rule of law and criminality,"" Browder also told the senators. ""And if we allow all the corrupt money to come here, then it's going to corrupt us until we end up like them.""

Natalia Veselnitskaya has become what Browder called ""the point person"" for Russia's fight to repeal the law. The Russian attorney has been lobbying against the Magnitsky Act for years, and fighting to discredit Browder.

She was thrust into the headlines recently when it was revealed she met with Donald Trump Jr. and two other top Trump campaign aides last June to try and sway them toward repealing the law should Trump win the presidency.

But in a series of emails exchanged to set up the meeting, Trump Jr. was told Veselnitskaya would have incriminating information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supplied by the Russian government in an effort to help his father's presidential campaign.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the committee's ranking member, asked Browder if the meeting could have been the Russian government's way of offering a ""quid pro quo"" in exchange for repealing the Magnitsky Act.

""This was a big ask,"" Browder said in response — in reference to repealing the U.S. law that essentially imposes global banking sanctions of Russian human rights abusers who are found to have violated it. ""They wouldn't have gone in and said 'please can you repeal this for us,' without having something to offer in return.""

Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya have both said no incriminating information about Clinton ended up changing hands in the meeting.

Putin's endgame

Browder's testimony also touched on one of the more perplexing aspects of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election — how Putin and the Russian government view now-President Trump given evidence Russia was gathering incriminating information about both Trump and Clinton at the same time.

Sen. Lindsey Graham's almost entire line of questioning on Thursday focused on the seeming contradiction in the fact that Russia allegedly has ties to a company behind the controversial and unverified dossier on Trump while Russia was also rooting for Trump to win on Election Day, according to to the emails exchanges with Trump Jr. prior to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.

""Is it common for Russia to play both sides against the middle?"" Graham asked.

""What you need to understand about the Russians is there is no ideology at all,"" Browder said. ""Vladimir Putin is in the business of trying to create chaos everywhere.""

President Trump has, at times, seemed to accept that Russia interfered in last year's election and, at other times, seemed to doubt that Russia was behind things like hacking emails systems and strategically releasing Democratic emails at key points in the 2016 campaign. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russian intelligence services, acting at Putin's direction, were responsible.

President Putin has repeatedly denied that the Russian government played any role in interfering in last year's election; he did so most recently during an in-person meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Germany.

Trump has also repeatedly denied that he or anyone associated with his campaign colluded with the Russians. On Thursday, the White House used the hearing as further proof President Trump wasn't colluding with the Russians to get himself elected.

""We learned that the firm that produced (the dossier) was also being paid by the Russians,"" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""This is yet the latest piece of evidence that vindicates what the President has said, that this is a witch hunt and a hoax.""

Browder explained to lawmakers, however, that it's not really a contradiction or a disconnect at all for Russia to be gathering potentially compromising information on Trump while also reaching out to his campaign to provide assistance and incriminating information about Clinton. That's because Putin's activities always seem to be designed to find leverage over his targets. In some cases, Russia will engage in an illegal activity to help a target and then hold the threat of exposure of that activity over the target's head.

""They've got you both ways: with the carrot of continued bribery, and the stick of exposure and blackmail if you defect?"" asked Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

""That is how every single one of their relationships work,"" Browder confirmed. ""That's how they grab people and keep them.

""And once you get stuck in with them, you can never leave.""

"Russia's recent cyber adventures have the hallmarks of an old Soviet specialty: disinformation.

While many Americans have just awoken to the world of disinformation — sometimes known as ""fake news"" — in the recent presidential election, Moscow's efforts date back decades and have become increasingly prominent over the past decade as techniques have been updated for the digital age.

The spread of disinformation through active measures was a central tactic of Soviet information operations as a way to influence foreign governments and their populations, undermine relations between nations, and weaken those who opposed communism.

Dezinformatsiya, as Russians call it, is meant to instill fear and confuse audiences, blurring the lines between truth, falsehood and reality.

Disinformation can spread conspiracy theories and reinforce ""filter bubbles"" that isolate readers and viewers from alternative viewpoints and can create a cloud of confusion and paranoia.

Spreading disinformation

I recently led an independent study on how Russia uses disinformation to influence ethnic Russians who live in former Soviet Union states.

In our report, we highlight how disinformation is effective because it is quick, cheap and yields high rewards. We assessed that Russia has a number of tools in its disinformation toolbox — including its state-run, Russian and English-language television network Russian Television, platforms such as the Sputnik news service that enable audiences outside Russia to subscribe to their services free of charge, and the deployment of trolls in the blogosphere and on social media.

In some instances, Russia's troll armies manage multiple fake accounts, and each account posts articles on social media 50 to 100 times a day.

Even before the explosion of social media, the effects of Russia's modern disinformation efforts could be seen during the 2008 Russo-Georgia war, when Russia used picture defacement to spread fake images and news stories. Russia hacked into Georgian infrastructure and the official website of then-Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili.

More recently, in Ukraine, Russia spread many conspiracy theories and fake stories in 2014, during the Crimea crisis and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. In the latter case, Western sources have pointed to a Russian missile being involved and believe it was fired by either the Russians themselves or Ukrainian separatists allied with Moscow.

Possible consequences

If unaddressed, Russia's disinformation tactics will have at least three significant consequences for global stability.

First, Russia's disinformation machinery could inspire other countries, terrorists, transnational criminal organizations and individuals to emulate this behavior. An immediate effect could be attempts to disrupt the coming elections in Germany, France, Serbia, and the Netherlands.

Different groups act for different reasons. Some purveyors of disinformation, like the Islamic State, have ideological motives. Others look at it as an easy way to make an extra dollar.

In Macedonia, for example, young people found it lucrative to set up websites to share fake news that interfered with the U.S. election. Their motives were more economic than political.

Second, disinformation can bleed into conspiracy theories that can instantly spread on social media and may have major national security implications.

In December, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad tweeted incorrectly that Israel was threatening Pakistan with nuclear weapons after this disinformation appeared on AWD News, a fake-news website.

While the Israeli Defense Ministry questioned this claim, the defense minister's tweet was reposted hundreds of times, spreading fake content within a matter of seconds.

Earlier in December, stolen emails containing a brief exchange between John Podesta and the owner of a pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, in Washington, D.C., led to a fake news story that a child sex ring was being run out of the restaurant. A North Carolina man then drove to Washington and fired a gun, saying he wanted to rescue sex slaves he was convinced were harbored at the restaurant.

Identifying disinformation

Third, Russia's disinformation campaigns help highlight one of the biggest and most dangerous challenges in Western society: an inability to think critically about information.

In a 24-7 news cycle and social-media universe, media consumers have developed an unprecedented need to access, process and spread information, be it true or not.

But the youth in particular have a limited ability to identify fake news content. If information seems newsworthy and provides high entertainment value, few people will think hard before tweeting it out or posting it on Facebook.

The challenge is further amplified when notable figures spread disinformation via social media, reinforcing the virtual conspiracy bubble. And when disinformation comes from those believed to be credible — such as friends, family and colleagues — it is even more likely to be treated uncritically, as factual information.

Countering Russia's disinformation will require a set of actions including debunking fake news, messaging and creating counternarratives for targeted populations both in the U.S. and globally who are sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin's policies; and strengthening individual and media literacy programs around the world.

The muddling mix of rumors, lies and news has dominated our conversation to the point that we are no longer certain what is true. Citizens, news and social media outlets, both organizations and users, cannot fall victim to disinformation. We have a responsibility to think critically about the information and stories that are disseminated. Without doing so, we will continue to empower Russia and others to spread disinformation and propaganda, risk our security and create distrust in our society.

"Diana Nyad, the champion long-distance open water swimmer, opened up about her past as a victim of sexual assault. Her op-ed in the New York Times is yet another case of a woman speaking out about sexual violence and harassment.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: 

On Twitter today, women all over the country are posting pictures of themselves at 14 with the hashtag #meat14. The photos underscore just what a serious violation it is when girls so young are targeted for sexual attention, especially by someone older and more powerful. The campaign is one response to accusations against Judge Roy Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama. The Washington Post reported he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old when he was a 32-year-old prosecutor. Moore says the accusation is, quote, ""completely false,"" unquote.

But all of this comes at a time when women around the world and across professions are speaking up about sexual abuse. And in response to that, some are asking, why now? Why bring this up years after the events are alleged to have taken place? Our next guest offers some perspective on that. Diana Nyad is known for her record-breaking long-distance swimming, but this past week, she wrote an essay for The New York Times about the swim coach who started molesting her when she was just 14 years old and the effect it had on her life for years.

Diana Nyad joined me earlier today from NPR West in Culver City, Calif. And let me say here this conversation may be upsetting to some for obvious reasons. We'll begin here at the point where I asked her what it means to her to see so many women coming forward with stories like hers.

DIANA NYAD: I am heartened, I'll tell you, Michel, that after all the years of trying to prosecute my perpetrator, even though I had corroborators - there were other people who went through the same thing with the same coach - we couldn't break through the system. But look at this. I am so heartened by these past few weeks of the education of the public. You just brought up the Roy Moore case.

People say, now, come on. If this were true, if this 14-year-old story were true, she - and it was that disturbing to her, she would come out with it sooner. She's waited all these years. Well, now, in just this short time, we've had a little bit of a cultural shift in the last few weeks in discussing all this to say that we get it. You are so traumatized. You think it's your fault, especially young people.

MARTIN: Why did you want to write this essay now? Was it in part to answer the why now question?

NYAD: It sort of started with just joining the me too, you know, movement. What we've started here is the archiving of the voices. And so many of those voices, I'll tell you right now, I am more angry about being silenced than I even am about being touched. You know, it's hard to say that, but let's just say it's equal to be pinned down and to be told, don't you ever tell anybody. You'll never have a life. You'll be thrown out of school. Your entire life will collapse if you tell anybody about our beautiful special secret. So I want to be one of the leaders of the voices who collect the archiving. And next, I want to be one of the leaders as to what the heck we're going to do about this to change this in our culture.

MARTIN: One of the things that really struck me is how very graphic you are about the effect that it had on you. I mean, I'll just start by reading the top of the essay. You start by saying, (reading) here I was, a strong-willed young athlete. There he was, a charismatic pillar of the community. But I am the one who after all these many years later at the age of 68, no matter how happy and together I may be, continues to deal with the rage and the shame that comes with being silenced. Talk about that a bit if you would. Talk a little bit about that rage. I mean, you said it just used to just come on you?

NYAD: Yeah, it can still. I don't like to admit it, but now I'm at the point that I've just got to be an open book because all - you know, the thousands of people I've heard from over these past 48 hours since that Times op-ed piece hit are saying, you know, these precise same symptoms. And one of them is that you're in a rage. You're in a rage that it happened. You're in a rage toward your perpetrator. And unfortunately, you're in a rage toward yourself for not stopping it.

So I have to admit that I have an imprint. I wake up, you know, with joy. I have a strong will. I have an iron will. And still there's that region side of no, you do not silence me. You don't pin me down. You don't make me touch your disgusting body. I just - you know, that man's deceased now, but I've been going through this all my life. And I think one of the little cultural shifts that's happening out there when people are getting educated is they're saying, you know what? It isn't a momentary thing. You don't just suffer that trauma and then you're over it. It's a life-long deal.

MARTIN: Do you feel free now?

NYAD: Oh, no. I've been speaking about this for 50 years, so I don't feel freer for speaking about it again this week. What I feel is gratification that this country is addressing this issue. I don't feel freer. I feel gritty. I'm going to get down to the work of trying to make a big change in the United States.

MARTIN: That's Diana Nyad. She's a record-breaking swimmer, author and motivational speaker. You can read her latest essay, ""My Life After Sexual Assault"" in the New York Times Opinion section. Diana Nyad, thank you so much for speaking with us.

NYAD: Thank you, Michel. I appreciate it.

"If the saga of Michael Flynn feels like it's been hanging over President Trump's head since Inauguration Day, that's because it has.

The story of how Trump's first national security adviser came to plead guilty to lying to FBI investigators and cooperate in the special counsel's Russia investigation spans two presidential terms and also touches government officials who were subsequently fired by Trump.

Here are 10 key events that explain why Flynn was legally vulnerable in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and why his plea deal addresses one of the central questions in the wider Russia imbroglio.

1. President Obama sanctions Russia

On Dec. 28, 2016, then-President Barack Obama ejects 35 Russian diplomats from the United States and introduces new sanctions against a number of Russian security services and individuals.

The move is retribution for Russia's interference in the 2016 election, detailed in the unclassified summary of a highly classified report by the intelligence community early in the new year.

2. Flynn confers with transition officials and talks sanctions with Russia

On Dec. 29, Flynn speaks with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, as well as a ""senior official"" of the presidential transition team, according to court documents in Flynn's case.

The documents describe how Flynn spoke to his colleague in the administration-in-waiting — identified by some outlets as former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland — about what to tell the Russian ambassador about the sanctions. Then he spoke with Kislyak on the phone.

""Flynn called the Russian ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. sanctions in a reciprocal manner,"" say the court documents. The Trump camp wants to offer Moscow the prospect for a better relationship once Trump is inaugurated.

On Dec. 31, Kislyak calls Flynn back and says Russia indeed will not escalate, as he asked. Russian President Vladimir Putin confirms that with a public announcement, which Trump hails on Twitter.

Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!

3. Pence denies Flynn talked sanctions

After a Washington Post report alludes to Flynn's conversation, the administration-in-waiting begins denying they discussed sanctions. Not only is there suspicion about the issue itself; the question is raised about whether Flynn might have violated an obscure law that forbids Americans out of government to negotiate on behalf of the United States.

So on Jan. 15, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence makes a case to CBS's Face the Nation.

""What I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions,"" Pence said.

But the FBI, which was monitoring Kislyak's communications, knew that wasn't so.

4. FBI investigators interview Flynn

On Jan. 24, Flynn gives a voluntary interview to FBI investigators looking at Russian interference.

In this interview, according to the charging documents, Flynn makes false statements about whether he asked Kislyak to refrain from ""escalating the situation."" He also says that he doesn't remember the follow-up conversation in which Kislyak confirms Russia's decision regarding a sanctions escalation.

Mueller's team also now says Flynn gave false statements in the interview about calls he made regarding a United Nations Security Council resolution.

5. Sally Yates warns the White House about Flynn

On Jan. 26, acting Attorney General Sally Yates meets with White House counsel Don McGahn to warn him the Justice Department has evidence, via the FBI surveillance, that what Pence was saying publicly was inaccurate.

""We told him we felt like the vice president and others were entitled to know that the information that they were conveying to the American people wasn't true,"" Yates said in testimony to a Senate Judiciary panel in May.

She adds that because Russian diplomatic and intelligence officials also knew about the content of the conversations — and probably had their own proof of them — Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail.

""We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" she said. ""To state the obvious, you don't want your national security adviser compromised by the Russians.""

Yates and McGahn meet again the next day, Jan. 27, and they begin discussing ways that White House officials might review the evidence the FBI has about Flynn.

But Yates is fired by Trump three days later after announcing she will not defend his travel restrictions on refugees and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries.

The White House also says McGahn told Trump about Yates' warning that Flynn had lied to Pence and likely given the same account to the FBI.

6. Trump asks Comey for ""loyalty""

On Jan. 27, President Trump arranges a dinner with then-FBI Director James Comey, where, according to Comey's testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the president says: ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.""

It was uncomfortable, Comey said.

""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,"" Comey said. ""We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.""

Comey said he felt like the dinner was an effort on the part of the president to have him ask for his job and ""create some sort of patronage relationship.""

7. Flynn is fired ... 

On Feb. 13, Trump fires Flynn, after leaks reveal that Flynn did in fact talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Flynn continues to deny the accusations, as close as four days before he is fired.

8. ... and Trump wonders aloud if Comey can let Flynn go

On Feb. 14, Comey goes to the Oval Office for a counterterrorism meeting, and Trump asks him to stick around afterward for a one-on-one meeting.

""When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,' "" Comey testified in June. ""He then said, 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' ""

Comey agrees Flynn is a ""good guy"" but says he will not agree to let it go.

9. Trump fires Comey

On May 9, Trump fires Comey, saying in an interview two days later that the FBI director was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander.""

Trump also mentions the FBI's Russia investigation, which Comey was leading — ""this Russia thing,"" as Trump calls it.

Discussion in Washington broadens from the question of potential collusion between the Trump camp and the Russian attack on the election to the question of obstruction of justice. Did the president try to get rid of the FBI director to keep him from finding out something Trump wanted to keep hidden? Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein responds by appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel in the case.

10. Flynn pleads guilty, agrees to cooperate

On Nov. 30, Flynn signs a plea agreement with Mueller in which he acknowledges lying to the FBI about his sanctions conversation. On Dec. 1, Flynn appears in court and his deal becomes public.

The deal delivers to Mueller a witness who spent nearly all the 2016 campaign and the presidential transition at Trump's elbow, one who was involved with many conversations with foreigners, including key Russians. Flynn's cooperation resets the clock on the Russia imbroglio as he begins debriefing Mueller and his team.

"A majority of whites say discrimination against them exists in America today, according to a poll released Tuesday from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""If you apply for a job, they seem to give the blacks the first crack at it,"" said 68-year-old Tim Hershman of Akron, Ohio, ""and, basically, you know, if you want any help from the government, if you're white, you don't get it. If you're black, you get it.""

More than half of whites — 55 percent — surveyed say that, generally speaking, they believe there is discrimination against white people in America today. Hershman's view is similar to what was heard on the campaign trail at Trump rally after Trump rally. Donald Trump catered to white grievance during the 2016 presidential campaign and has done so as president as well.

Notable, however, is that while a majority of whites in the poll say discrimination against them exists, a much smaller percentage say that they have actually experienced it. Also important to note is that 84 percent of whites believe discrimination exists against racial and ethnic minorities in America today.

Loading...

People from every racial or ethnic group surveyed said they believe theirs faces discrimination — from African-Americans and Latinos to Native Americans and Asian-Americans, as well as whites.

The NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health survey sampled 3,453 adults in the U.S. from Jan. 26 to April 9. Of those, 902 were white.

The responses from whites can be broken down into three categories. Those who:

1. Believe there is anti-white discrimination and say they have personally experienced it,

2. Say there is indeed anti-white discrimination but say they have never felt it themselves, and

3. Say there is no discrimination of whites in America

White and discriminated against?

Ask Hershman whether there is discrimination against whites, and he answered even before this reporter could finish the question — with an emphatic ""Absolutely.""

""It's been going on for decades, and it's been getting worse for whites,"" Hershman contended, despite data showing whites continue to be better off financially and educationally than minority groups.

Even though Hershman believes he has been a victim of anti-white discrimination, he wasn't able to provide a specific example. He describes losing out on a promotion — and a younger African-American being selected as one of the finalists for the job. But the position eventually went to a white applicant, who was also younger than Hershman.

Discrimination exists, but never felt it

Representing Category 2 is 50-year-old heavy equipment operator Tim Musick, who lives in Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. He says anti-white discrimination is real, but he doesn't think he has ever really felt it personally.

""I think that you pretty much, because you're white, you're automatically thrown into that group as being a bigot and a racist and that somehow you perceive yourself as being more superior to everybody else, which is ridiculous,"" Musick said, speaking during his lunch break at a construction site.

""I'm just a man that happens to have been born white,"" Musick continued.

He also makes it clear, however, that he is not comparing what happens to whites to the African-American experience.

""I don't know what it feels like to be a black man walking around in the streets, but I do know what it feels like to be pegged, because of how you look, and what people perceive just on sight,"" said Musick, who has the stocky build of a retired NFL lineman and a shaved head under his hard hat.

Whites who don't believe they are discriminated against

Now for the third category — those who scoff at the notion that whites face racial discrimination.

That describes retired community college English teacher Betty Holton, of Elkton, Md.

""I don't see how we can be discriminated against when, when we have all the power,"" Holton said, chuckling in disbelief into her cellphone.

""Look at Congress. Look at the Senate. Look at government on every level. Look at the leadership in corporations. Look. Look anywhere.""

Holton asserts: ""The notion that whites are discriminated against just seems incredible to me.""

Perception based on income

Income also seemed to affect individual responses to the question of discrimination.

Lower- and moderate-income white Americans were more likely to say that whites are discriminated against — and to say they have felt it, either when applying for a job, raise or promotion or in the college-admissions process.

""We've long seen a partisan divide with Democrats more likely to say racial discrimination is that reason blacks can't get ahead, but that partisan divide is even bigger than it has been in the past,"" said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew Research Center. ""That's a point where we do see that partisan divides over issues of race have really increased in recent years.""

What this could mean for electoral politics

David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron, said the finding that a majority of whites say whites are victims of discrimination fits right into one of the big narratives of the last presidential campaign.

""I think this does reinforce a lot of the resentment you saw in the 2016 election, especially among white, working-class voters lacking a college degree,"" said Cohen, who lives in northeastern Ohio, a traditionally Democratic stronghold full of white, working-class union members.

Trump ran far better there, though, than Republicans typically do, as he easily won the battleground state of Ohio, 52 percent to 44 percent.

But Cohen also adds that for all of the talk of Trump's message speaking directly to whites in the working class — white voters overall supported him in about the same numbers as they did for Mitt Romney four years earlier — 58 percent for Trump, 59 percent for Romney.

And though it's possible that Trump's message to disaffected whites did make a difference in the decisive battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Cohen said the question remains: Did Trump create or significantly boost white resentment overall — or did he simply tap into a trend with deep roots and history?

""I'm not sure that he necessarily created this angst among white voters,"" Cohen said, ""but he certainly knew how to take advantage of it.""

And it's something Trump — as president — has only continued to tap into.

An earlier version of this story incorrectly said: ""More than half of whites — 55 percent — surveyed say they face discrimination on the job, in education and in a variety of other ways."" The poll question asked whether respondents believed discrimination against white people exists in the U.S. today generally speaking. The poll found that at most, 19 percent of whites say they have personally faced discrimination while applying for jobs.

"Last week in the Russia investigations: Washington, D.C., gears up for the big show; Trump campaign data firm's guru tried to link up with WikiLeaks; and Clinton, DNC helped pay for infamous dossier on Trump.

After weeks of buildups, letdowns, surprises, scoops and headlines, this is it: Three central players in the world of Big Tech are set to face off across the witness table this week from members of Congress.

The circus comes to town on Tuesday afternoon with a late-addition, thunder-stealing session scheduled by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The chairman, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., jumped ahead of two long-scheduled hearings on Wednesday in the Senate and then House Intelligence committees.

Now, Graham wants to get Google, Facebook and Twitter on the record first.

(This isn't the first time these panels have tangled over the Russia imbroglio. The ostensibly more prestigious, senior Senate Judiciary Committee resents the comparative upstart Senate Intelligence Committee — but lacks the intelligence panel's direct oversight of spy agencies and its access to superprimo national security secrets.)

Anyway, lawmakers — especially Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va. — have been talking this up for a long time. But don't expect the hearings to match the spectacle offered in June by former FBI Director James Comey.

Instead, the representatives of Google, Facebook and Twitter — men whose faces you don't recognize, with names you don't know — are expected to try as hard as they can to be boring.

They don't want histrionics. They don't want to be ensnared into soundbites. They want to comply with their invitations to appear, restate their earnest commitment to playing ball and then get safely back over the battlements into Silicon Valley.

That Russian influencemongers used Facebook, Google, Twitter and other online platforms in the overt part of their attack on the 2016 U.S. election is not in dispute.

Each company has acknowledged selling ads to Russian-linked buyers or, in the case of Facebook and Twitter, the presence of fake or automated accounts that wreaked all kinds of interference within the U.S. What is in dispute is what action to take now.

Warner, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have a bill that would mandate disclosure about online political ads. But Facebook and Twitter say they're already planning to take industry-leading new steps on transparency.

The hearing on Wednesday could provide new indications about how strongly each side of this — Congress on the one and Big Tech on the other — feels about the cards it is holding.

One of the Russians who met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign bigwigs in Trump Tower last year conferred beforehand with Russia's top federal prosecutor, Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew E. Kramer report in The New York Times.

You haven't heard Natalia Veselnitskaya's name for a while, but she was part of a delegation that visited New York after Trump Jr. received an email that described an offer of help from the Russian prosecutor, Yuri Chaika. And, in fact, Veselnitskaya consulted with Chaika, the Times confirms:

""The coordination between the Trump Tower visitor and the Russian prosecutor general undercuts Ms. Veselnitskaya's account that she was a purely independent actor when she sat down with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, then the Trump campaign chairman.

It also suggests that emails from an intermediary to the younger Mr. Trump promising that Ms. Veselnitskaya would arrive with information from Russian prosecutors were rooted at least partly in fact — not mere 'puffery,' as the president's son later said.""

The boss of a data analytics shop used by the Trump campaign last year emailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to ask him to collaborate on releasing the emails Hillary Clinton deleted from her private server, Betsy Woodruff reports in The Daily Beast.

Alexander Nix, who runs the analytics company that helped with the Trump campaign's pioneering digital operation, pinged Assange to ask how Nix could somehow help WikiLeaks release the Clinton emails.

Assange later confirmed the contact took place but said they did not work together.

The story is significant because it confirms direct contact between people in the Trump orbit and WikiLeaks. Trump adviser Roger Stone says he talked with Assange via an ""intermediary,"" whom he won't identify. And it's at least the second example of people working behind the scenes on projects involving the elusive Clinton emails.

Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that a Republican operative contacted a British cyber expert to ask him for help in verifying an offer of the Clinton emails from ""the Dark Web."" The emails have never emerged, but the latest developments revive the question about whether they might, in fact, be out there somewhere, in the hands of Russia's GRU intelligence agency or elsewhere.

The U.S. intelligence community loathes WikiLeaks; CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said it amounts to a hostile foreign intelligence service. Trump, as a candidate, said he loved WikiLeaks because it had released so many embarrassing secrets about Hillary Clinton, her campaign chairman John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and other Trump foes.

That material was pilfered by Russian government hackers and then fenced through WikiLeaks and other websites as part of the clandestine side of the Russian influence campaign against the United States in the last presidential election cycle. Amid all the ongoing talk about the overt side involving social networks, it's important not to lose sight of both sides of the coin.

Everybody knew in general terms that Democrats had paid for the infamous, unverified Trump-Russia dossier after taking it over from a Republican primary challenger to Donald Trump. Now, however, Adam Entous, Devlin Barrett and Rosalind S. Helderman of The Washington Post have filled in some of the details — and their story has flipped the politics of the Russia imbroglio upside down.

The Post correspondents confirmed the details of payments for the dossier by Clinton's campaign, and, in so doing, have created a potent new weapon for the White House and Republicans. This whole thing is an outrageous political hatchet job, says the president and his allies, they can argue. If this is supposed to be the case that Trump colluded with Russia in 2016 — there is no case!

The dossier, which NPR has not detailed because it remains unverified, was not the basis for the intelligence community's report about Russia's attack on the 2016 election, nor is it connected with the in-person meetings between people in Trump world and Russians, etc. There is much more to the Russia imbroglio.

The Post's report enticed Trump and allies to take the offense, and it landed at a propitious time for Republicans. Also last week, the leaders of the House Judiciary, Oversight and Intelligence committees said they were launching new investigations into Clinton and the practices of former President Barack Obama's administration, as NPR's Miles Parks reports.

As the week ended, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, disclosed that it had retained the firm that produced the dossier. But it added that none of the work product it received appears in the dossier. The New York Times reported that ""The Free Beacon told the firm to stop doing research on Mr. Trump in May 2016"" and the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee ""had begun paying Fusion GPS in April for research that eventually became the basis for the dossier.""

"The first charges have been filed in the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, and the court documents help make clearer the timeline of Russia-related events that took place during the presidential campaign.

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, indicted on 12 counts unrelated to his work on the campaign, is the big name. But the guilty plea of an obscure foreign policy adviser named George Papadopoulos has proven more revealing when it comes to alleged connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Court documents filed Monday add new information to a timeline of events that now involves multiple known contacts between people associated with the Trump campaign and Russian actors.

The order and nature of events during the spring and summer of 2016 became increasingly relevant in June, with revelations about a meeting between Russian nationals, Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.

Here's a timeline of key Russia-related 2016 events:

2006-2016: According to a 12-count indictment unsealed on Oct. 30, 2017, ""from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, Manafort and Gates laundered money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts."" Paul Manafort served on the Trump campaign from March 2016 through August 2016, serving as campaign chairman from May until August. Richard Gates is a former business partner of Manafort's who followed him to the Trump campaign as his deputy. After Manafort was ousted from the campaign, Gates moved to the Republican National Committee to work out legal agreements with Trump's campaign and ultimately served on Trump's inaugural committee.

""Early March"" 2016: According to Justice Department documents, George Papadopoulos learns he will be a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

March 14, 2016: Papadopoulos, while traveling in Italy, meets a London-based professor. Per a special counsel filing, ""initially, the professor seemed uninterested"" in him. ""However, after defendant Papadopoulos informed the professor about joining the campaign, the professor appeared to take great interest"" in him. The professor had ""claimed to have substantial connections with Russian government officials,"" which according to the filing, Papadopoulos thought would help his standing as a foreign policy adviser for the campaign. (Editor's note: Many of the dates pertaining to Papadopoulos are described as ""on or about"" that date in the legal documents. We have omitted that caveat for clarity. See the original Justice Department language here.)

March 19, 2016: Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta reportedly receives a phishing email, which led to the theft of thousands of his emails going back years, including embarrassing campaign correspondence. Those emails were then posted by Wikileaks in batches beginning in early October and continuing right through the election. The US intelligence community concluded Russia's intelligence agency, the GRU, was responsible for the hacking. 

March 21, 2016: Trump cites Papadopoulos as a foreign policy adviser in Washington Post editorial board meeting. Carter Page is also mentioned. Trump told the Post:

""Well, I hadn't thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names... Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he's an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that's a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that's a representative group.""

March 24, 2016: Papadopoulos meets in London with the professor, who brought with him a female Russian national introduced to him ""as a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin with connections to senior Russian government officials."" Papadopoulos then emails a ""campaign supervisor"" not named in court filings as well as ""several members of the Campaign's foreign policy team,"" recounting his meeting with the professor, the woman whom Papadopoulos described as Putin's niece (the filings note he later learned she was not actually related to Putin). Papadopoulos said the topic of the discussion was ""to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russian ties under President Trump.""

March 28, 2016: Trump brings on Manafort to manage delegate operations for the campaign.

March 31: According to court filings, Papadopoulos attended a ""national security meeting"" in Washington, D.C., with then-candidate Trump and other foreign policy advisers for the campaign. Per the filings, when Papadopoulos introduced himself to the group, he said he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between Trump and President Putin.

A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Mar 31, 2016 at 7:09pm PDT

April 18, 2016: Around this day, Papadopoulos is introduced by email to a person in Moscow who was said to have connections to the Russian Foreign Ministry. According to court filings, Papadopoulos and this individual have multiple conversations over Skype and email about ""setting 'the groundwork' for a 'potential' meeting"" between the campaign and Russian officials.

April 25, 2016: Papadopoulos emails an unnamed senior policy adviser to the campaign, saying, ""The Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to met when he is ready []. The advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.""

April 26, 2016: Papadopoulos meets with the professor in London. The professor tells Papadopoulos that he had just returned from a trip to Moscow, where he met with high-level government officials and learned that the Russians had obtained ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. ""They have thousands of emails,"" the professor said, according to Papadopoulos' statements to the FBI.

April 27, 2016: In a major foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., Trump indicates a willingness to work with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only, is possible, absolutely possible,"" he said. ""Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries. Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out.""

Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the U.S., was sitting in the front row, according to a report by Radio Free Europe.

On this same day, Papadopoulos separately emails a ""senior policy advisor"" and a ""high-ranking"" campaign official, both unnamed in legal filings. He told the adviser he had ""some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right."" He told the campaign official that he had been receiving ""a lot of calls"" about Putin wanting to host Trump and his team.

May 18, 2016: James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, warns of some indications of cyberattacks against the 2016 presidential election. In a cyber-event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., Clapper said ""as the campaigns intensify we'll probably have more of it.""

June 2, 2016: In early June, as the primaries in both parties were winding down, Clinton turned her fire to Trump in what was widely considered one of the strongest moments of her campaign.

""Now I will leave it to psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,"" Clinton said in San Diego, Calif. ""I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are. Because it matters. If you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.""

June 3, 2016: Music promoter Rob Goldstone emails Trump Jr. about setting up a meeting with a Russian government-connected lawyer, among other people, to discuss incriminating information about Clinton. Goldstone works with Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian billionaire developer Aras Agalarov. The Agalarovs already knew the future American president through connections established when Trump Sr. held the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013.

""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. ""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump...""

Trump Jr. was traveling at the time, but it took him just 20 minutes to reply: ""if it's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer.""

June 7, 2016: The 2016 primary season essentially concludes with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as their parties' presumptive nominees. At his primary night victory speech, Trump previews an upcoming attack in the form of a ""major speech"" he says he's planning to give in the next few days.

""I am going to give a major speech on, probably Monday of next week, and we are going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,"" Trump said. ""I think you are going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.""

Just hours before, Rob Goldstone had finalized plans for the meeting between Trump Jr., Natalia Veselnitskaya and others.

June 9, 2016: Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, meet in Trump Tower with Veselnitskaya, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin and another Russian-American present to represent the interests of the Agalarovs.

While the meeting was represented to include damaging information about Hillary Clinton, it instead focused on the Magnitsky Act.

""I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,"" Veselnitskaya told MSNBC.

Donald Trump Jr. later told Fox News' Sean Hannity that the meeting was ""literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

That afternoon, Donald Trump tweets for the first time about Hillary Clinton's emails. 

How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted? https://t.co/gECLNtQizQ

June 14, 2016: News breaks of two separate Russian breaches into the Democratic National Committee's computer network. The hacks were perpetrated by Russian groups that have become known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, identified by Washington, D.C., computer security company CrowdStrike. The hackers had been monitoring the DNC's computer network for a year.

June 22, 2016: In a speech in New York, Trump speculates that foreign adversaries may have hacked Clinton's emails.

""So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be president of the United States,"" he said. ""This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.""

July 5, 2016: FBI Director James Comey recommends no charges against Clinton for her handling of classified emails while she was secretary of state. Comey did, however, raise questions about her judgment, and described Clinton and her staff as being ""extremely careless."" On July 2, Clinton told investigators her use of the private server was for convenience, not to avoid proper record-keeping.

July 7, 2016: Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser, gives a Russia-friendly speech in Moscow. This leads FBI investigators to obtain a secret warrant to monitor Page's communications.

July 18, 2016: Just before the Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign worked behind the scenes to change the GOP's platform on Ukraine. The campaign announced that they would not call for the U.S. to give weapons to the Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.

July 21, 2016: The GOP convention concludes with Trump giving an ominous speech accepting the Republican nomination. Trump spoke about the country's struggles with terrorism, crime and immigration, and vows to put ""America first.""

""This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,"" he said.

July 22, 2016: WikiLeaks publishes a first batch of almost 20,000 DNC emails, many of them discussing how to undermine Sen. Bernie Sander's campaign. WikiLeaks officials stated that the emails come from the accounts of ""seven key figures in the DNC.""

The timing here is important, as the emails are published less than a week before the start of the Democratic National Convention, when candidates typically receive a polling boost.

July 23, 2016: Trump continues pushing his theory of a ""rigged"" election process, in a tweet about the newly released emails.

""Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders,"" he says. ""Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED""

 July 24, 2016: Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigns in the wake of the DNC email hacking scandal. After Schultz's abrupt resignation, Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge was named the chair of the Democratic convention and Donna Brazile, former Al Gore campaign manager and Bill Clinton adviser, temporarily takes control of the Democratic Party through the election.

July 27, 2016: At a news conference, Trump has an overt message for Russia, in relation to Hillary Clinton's emails.

""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" he said. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""

Clinton's campaign reacted predictably, with outrage, saying Trump was encouraging espionage by a foreign government.

Also during the summer, according to the Daily Beast and CNN, the head of Cambridge Analytics, a data firm that did work for the Trump campaign, reaches out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and offered to help organize and release Hillary Clinton's missing 33,000 missing emails. Assange later confirmed on Twitter that a contact was made, but said the offer was rejected.

I can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica [prior to November last year] and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.

Analytica is financially backed by billionaire Trump supporter Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. Clinton said she deleted 33,000 personal emails from her time as secretary of state. To this date they have been the subject of much interest, including from Trump, who still mentions them regularly.

Aug. 4, 2016: Obama CIA Director John Brennan confronts his Russian counterpart about Russia's interference, as he later recounted in congressional testimony in May 2017. ""[I] told him if you go down this road, it's going to have serious consequences, not only for the bilateral relationship, but for our ability to work with Russia on any issue, because it is an assault on our democracy,"" Brennan said on Meet the Press in July 2017. Brennan's statements also followed attacks that the Obama administration faltered on deflecting Russian interference in the 2016 elections.

Aug. 15, 2016: According to legal filings on Papadopoulos, after weeks of back and forth about a possible ""off the record"" trip to Moscow, a campaign supervisor writes in an email, "" 'I would encourage you"" and another foreign policy adviser to the Campaign to 'make the trip [], if it is feasible.' "" The trip did not take place.

Aug. 19, 2016: Manafort resigns from the Trump campaign amid reports of suspicious payments for work he did for Russian linked elements in Ukraine. This marks the second shakeup of Trump senior campaign staff.

Aug. 21, 2016: Roger Stone cryptically cryptically tweets, ""Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel, #Crooked Hillary"" (his Twitter account was suspended in late October 2017.) Podesta was among the primary targets of hacks to the Democratic National Committee computer network; his emails were released by WikiLeaks starting Oct. 7.

 Sept. 8, 2016: Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., meets with Kislyak in his Senate Office. This would be reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by NPR in March 2017, the same day that Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., questioned Sessions about the meeting during Sessions' confirmation hearing to be attorney general. Sessions maintains that he never met with Russians or intermediaries ""about the Trump campaign,"" even though he was a top surrogate for the campaign at the time. Sessions did ultimately recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

Jan. 27, 2017: Papadopoulos sits for an interview with the FBI, during which he ""made material false statements and material omissions,"" according to court filings released Oct. 30.

Oct. 5, 2017: Papadopoulos pleads guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.

"Updated at 7:14 p.m. ET

After a monumental legislative victory on taxes this week, Republicans in Congress have been scrambling to avoid a chaotic government shutdown that could overshadow their signature tax bill before it even gets signed into law.

The House and Senate passed a spending bill on Thursday that would push a deadline to fund the government back from midnight on Friday to Jan. 19, allowing lawmakers to head home for the holidays without resolving much of their unfinished business. In addition to most Republicans, about a dozen House Democrats and several Senate Democrats also voted for the bill. 

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had put it on the GOP to keep the government open. ""The Republicans control the Congress. They control the House, they control the Senate, and they have the signature in the White House. They have the votes to keep government open. They don't need us to keep government open,"" she said Thursday. 

Still, President Trump sought to toss blame for the tense moment at congressional Democrats on Twitter on Thursday morning. 

House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, Tax Cuts. House Republicans, don’t let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!

The continuing resolution that Republicans in the House had released early Thursday punts tough decisions related to long-term government spending, immigration and defense into the first part of the new year.

Republicans needed at least some bipartisan support for the measure in the Senate, as the bill requires 60 votes to be approved, and Republicans control just 52 seats there.

In addition to keeping the government open, the legislation extends short-term authorizations for the Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to receive health care at community providers outside of the Veterans Affairs system.

The bill also temporarily extends a controversial provision in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, Amendments Act, known as Section 702, which was set to expire at the end of the year. The FBI and other intelligence agencies have said it is critical to fighting terrorism.

The stopgap bill includes a nod to defense hawks in Congress who were hoping for caps on defense spending to be lifted, another point of friction with Democrats being delayed. It provides funds to repair two naval ships that were damaged this year in the Pacific, as well as money to bolster ballistic missile defense.

A big disaster relief funding bill for areas hit by hurricanes and wildfires was passed in the House as well, but it appears the Senate will hold off on voting on that bill until January. 

In the new year, when bipartisan budget debates begin again, a pair of major polarizing topics loom. 

Congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, are hoping for legislation to protect thousands of undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as children. There had been talk that Democrats could threaten a government shutdown to force a vote on the measure, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, but those whispers quieted as the deadline grew closer.

Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era protection program in September, but White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said Thursday that the president was always hoping for Congress to come up with a legislative solution. 

""We believe we'll have a resolution to that in January or February,"" Short told NPR's Rachel Martin.

And a pair of senators are poised to propose legislation to stabilize insurance markets, after the Republican tax plan zeroed out the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that had required people to buy health insurance. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had committed to getting legislation passed by the end of the year, but she and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., have now committed to a proposal ""after the first of the year.""

Collins and Alexander said in a joint statement that they would be waiting to unveil the legislation because ""it has become clear that Congress will only be able to pass another short-term extension to prevent a government shutdown and to continue a few essential programs."" 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledged again on Thursday to bring that legislation up for a vote next year in an interview with NPR.

"Citing an investigation that found systematic and state-supported cheating by Russia's athletes during the Sochi Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency says that all Russian athletes and government officials should be barred from this summer's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

WADA is calling for the ban shortly after the agency released a 103-page report from Richard McLaren, a Canadian who was asked by WADA to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of widespread cheating — including, most notably, claims that Russian officials regularly swapped out athletes' drug-tainted samples for clean ones that would pass inspection.

Here's some of what the McLaren report found:

In proposing a total ban on Russian athletes from both the Olympics and Paralympics, WADA is going a step further than the ban on Russian track and field athletes that was issued last month by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

The International Olympic Committee says that its executive board will hold a telephone conference Tuesday to consider possible sanctions that would include the 2016 Rio games.

""The findings of the report show a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games,"" IOC President Thomas Bach says. ""Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organization implicated.""

The issue of doping has hung over the international athletics scene for years now — including earlier this month, when the U.S. track and field Olympic trials was the scene of an unusual ceremony in which American shot-putter Adam Nelson was awarded a gold medal for his performance in the 2004 games in Athens. The original gold medalist in that competition, Yuriy Bilonogof of Ukraine, ""tested positive for banned anabolic steroids in a retest of his urine sample from 2004,"" as NPR's Tom Goldman reported for The Torch.

Responding to the new WADA report, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun says:

""The McClaren Report confirms what we have stated previously: the current anti-doping system is broken and urgently requires the attention of everyone interested in protecting clean athletes. We look forward to working with the IOC, WADA and the entire Olympic family to address the flaws in the current system so that a uniform approach to anti-doping can be implemented and enforced around the world.""

As for the coming Summer Olympics, Blackmun says, the goal should be to ""give clean athletes some measure of comfort that they will be competing on a level playing field in Rio.""

As for what might have motivated some of Russia's top officials to engage in what's being called institutionalized cheating, Michael Newcity, a Russian scholar at Duke University, says that the Sochi Winter Olympics ""were intended as a reminder to the world that Russia remained relevant, powerful, and successful.""

With that in mind, he adds, ""the Russian government apparently decided that winning medals at any cost justified extensive and systematic cheating.""

"Now that Donald Trump Jr.'s emails have produced the kind of solid evidence the Russia connection story had been lacking, what had been mostly speculative reporting has instead become the first draft of history.

Expect that history to be much debated. All accounts of political skulduggery with foreign actors tend to be ""tangled and murky,"" as one foreign policy historian has written.

But one simple truth is that governments of all kinds have tried to influence political events in other countries if they can — and much of that work has been done in the shadows.

Surely the U.S. government has sought by various overt and covert means to shape events — to shore up friendly regimes and undermine hostile ones — in dozens of countries all over the world.

But that does not make Americans any happier with the idea of the Russians infiltrating our electoral process, or those of Europe or of democracies elsewhere. Such interference has proliferated and gained greater effectiveness in the Internet age, as the Russians have pursued and perfected the use of cybernetic means to distort politics on several levels.

Nor do Americans accept the behavior of Russia's enablers in the U.S. or other targeted countries. And that would appear to include elements of the Donald Trump presidential campaign in 2016. That was the unavoidable takeaway from the email news this week.

Obviously, it matters that the offending alien influence in this case was not just any foreign power but Russia — a longtime and salient adversary, led by an autocratic and militant Vladimir Putin, a veteran of the old Soviet spy apparatus known as the KGB.

Although ""vehemently denied"" by Putin and dismissed as ""a witch hunt"" by President Trump, the Russia connection has been reported as real by 17 U.S. intelligence agencies — four of which have also concluded that the intent was to harm Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump. (The others either expressed no opinion regarding the Russians' intent or were not asked to do so.)

So most Americans are justifiably concerned about the whole business. But for context, we should remember that Russia's latest effort is not the first instance of foreign meddling in a U.S. election nor is Trump's the first presidential campaign to be accused of collusion with a foreign power.

As far back as the 1790s, European powers were intent on involving Americans in their wars. First, it was the French employing various stratagems to get our backing in their battles with Great Britain. Later, the British worked hard to draw us into World War I against the Germans and to overcome the isolationism that initially kept us out of World War II. Those ultimately successful campaigns were conducted both in public and behind the scenes.

During the Cold War, the Russians of the Soviet era worked at exploiting racial tensions in the postwar U.S., even as the U.S. was working hard to isolate and defeat leftist parties of various kinds in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.

Political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University has compiled a Cold War database, citing 36 cases of Russian intervention in another country's elections between 1946 and 2000 — and another 81 instances of similar intervention by the U.S. over the same period of time. These struggles around the globe often featured agents of the CIA battling their counterparts from the KGB, the Soviet-era agency that produced Putin, his worldview and his tactics.

Over the years, there have also been stories of American presidential campaigns turning to foreign governments to advance their own interests in the heat of a campaign.

Nixon, Vietnam, Anna Chennault and... treason?

Perhaps the most compelling example is the contact between Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign and the government of South Vietnam at a critical point in negotiations to end the war in Vietnam. President Lyndon Johnson became convinced that Nixon, through the Chinese-born Anna Chennault, was urging the South Vietnamese to leave the talks.

The election was just days off, and Nixon's lead in the polls was waning. Nixon reportedly feared there would be a breakthrough shortly before election eve.

Declassified tapes in 2013 included audio of Chennault telling South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu to ""just hang in there through the election."" Nixon biographer John A. Farrell reports that Johnson sent a message to Nixon through an intermediary (Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen) warning that Nixon was committing treason by interfering to prolong the war.

Johnson considered going public with what he knew of Nixon's efforts in 1968. But he knew that doing so would mean revealing the extent of his surveillance of various parties involved. And, with Nixon's lead in the polls fading in late October, Johnson may have concluded it was neither prudent nor necessary to make such a move.

It was a decision not unlike the one President Barack Obama would make in 2016 when faced with evidence of Russian interference. Obama warned Putin but did not go public with what he knew, apparently believing Clinton was winning anyway and any intervention from the White House might backfire.

Reagan and the Iranian hostages

Questions have also been raised about secret contacts between Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and Iranian officials at a time when 52 American hostages were being held in Tehran. The Reagan camp reportedly feared an ""October surprise"" in which the incumbent President Jimmy Carter would secure his own re-election by winning the release of the hostages.

That did not happen, and the release took place on Jan. 20, 1981, the day Reagan was inaugurated. Reagan's team have always denied striking a bargain with the Iranians, but a PBS Frontline documentary in 1991 pointed to a July 1980 meeting in Madrid between William E. Casey (later to become CIA director) and a representative of the Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. No record of that meeting exists.

The PBS documentary relied on a book written by Middle East specialist Gary Sick, who had worked in the Carter administration. Sick said that ""some kind of discussions took place"" between the Reagan men and Iran but added ""the story is tangled and murky, and it may never be fully unraveled.""

The Ukrainian connection

Did the posture of the Reagan campaign have anything to do with when the hostages in Tehran were released? For that matter, did Nixon actually torpedo the Vietnam talks and allow that war to last well into the next decade?

Similar questions may linger over the Russia-Trump connection. It is always difficult to establish, either in real time or after the fact, just what factors determined the outcome of an election. And there can always be counterarguments and countervailing interpretations.

Some Republicans have noted, for example, that anti-Russian and anti-Trump Ukrainians may have been involved in the 2016 campaign on behalf of Clinton. In January, Politico reported that a Ukrainian-American with ties to the Democratic National Committee met with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy staff in an effort to ""expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.""

We may never know the exact extent or effectiveness of these efforts or of the Russian interference on behalf of Trump — any more than we know for certain the full impact of what Nixon and Reagan's campaigns did.

But the stories about these events persist, if only because they feed such powerful thoughts of ""what might have been.""

The same may well prove true of the allegations against the Trump campaign, whatever Congress and the special prosecutor decide.

"Buena Vista winery in Sonoma Valley, founded in 1857, is considered the birthplace of California wine. The cavernous cellar, carved into a hill by Chinese laborers, has survived earthquakes, several owners and last month's fires in Northern California.

Now, the black tree stumps and scorched hills right next to the winery's buildings show just how close the flames came — less than 30 feet, says Tom Blackwood, general manager at Buena Vista.

""The fire could not have come any closer without hitting the buildings. Buena Vista was surrounded by flames,"" says Blackwood, who credited firefighters with saving the winery, which withstood untouched. ""We are so lucky.""

But since Buena Vista reopened a couple of weeks ago, Blackwood is facing another problem: a big drop in visitors. During the month before the fires began, Buena Vista saw 6,000 visitors, says Blackwood. But since the winery reopened about two weeks ago, only 500 visitors have shown up.

""If the fires hadn't happened we would probably see about 50 or more people here at the bar,"" says Blackwood, gazing at the winery's relatively quiet tasting room. ""What do we have here, like six people now at the bar?""

Last month's fires in Northern California hit wine country during peak tourist season. While some businesses burned, many others were forced to close temporarily because of lack of road access or bad air quality when the fires raged. Now that the danger has passed, wineries and restaurants across the region are open and want visitors to return.

Most of the cancellations came from tourists who are not local, according to small businesses in Sonoma Valley — a region where burned hills, homes and cars can be seen.

""Once the fires were under control, we found that very few people had decided to return. There was initially a fear of the entire valley being burned,"" says Hunt Bailie, who owns a small segway and bicycle tour company with his wife in the town of Sonoma. He said about 90 percent of his tours were cancelled.

""We found that most folks are interested in returning, but they think it might be too soon,"" says Bailie. ""Typically October is the time when we can save all the pennies until spring, but that month dried up for us.""

While the affected areas were ""very limited,"" news coverage all over the world mostly showed destruction from the fires, says Caroline Beteta, who heads Visit California, the organization tasked with attracting tourists to the state.

""Just the imagery alone I would argue did more damage than the actual damage to the tourism infrastructure,"" Beteta told a conference of wine marketers in Santa Rosa, the biggest city in Sonoma county. News images of charred houses and red glowing skies flashed behind her.

Tim Zahner, chief operations officer for Sonoma County Tourism, says most hotels and wineries in the county are fine, and are pouring in their tasting rooms today.

""The weather is mild. You know if you're in Chicago and it's November and it's snowing, out here it is not snowing. It's gorgeous,"" says Zahner, who was also attending the wine marketing conference. ""It's a good time to come visit.""

His group and Beteta's are trying to convince visitors to return to the region. Visit California launched a $2 million dollar advertising campaign to bring back images of sunny vineyards and happy couples enjoying a glass of cabernet sauvignon — wine country images.

Economist Robert Eyler says it's too early to tell the economic impact of the fires on tourism. But he expects the county to overcome any downturn in visitors.

""The brand of Sonoma and wine country is going to survive because the brand is very very established,"" says Eyler, a professor at Sonoma State University. ""This is something that is a brand challenge in the short term. I would be flabbergasted if it was in the long.""

That brand is something local small business owners are counting on. People like Mingma Sherpa, who co-owns a Mexican restaurant about two miles from the fire line.

The immigrant from Nepal estimates half of his customers are gone. Before the fires, at least one tour bus would stop here daily, he said.

""Since that happened, most of them have cancelled,"" says Sherpa, adding that the sudden loss in revenue forced him to cut shifts for servers and other employees.

""It's definitely tough. But this town is very special. So hopefully they'll come back,"" he says.

"There is a grim kind of math that comes with war.

Most of the troops who died during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were flown to Dover Air Force base in Delaware. And for most of the wars, those dignified transfers were off limits to the press. That changed in 2009, when President Obama lifted the media ban and paid a visit to Dover himself.

From 2009 to the end of 2014, there were more than 2,400 dignified transfers at Dover. While the numbers are far smaller today, the planes are still flying troops home. The most recent: Petty Officer 3rd Class Devon J. Doyle, 21, of Colorado. The Pentagon says he died in Bahrain in a ""non-combat related incident,"" deployed as part of the U.S. fight against ISIS.

This week on For the Record: Memorial Day, inside Dover.

Dover looks like any other Air Force base, with a lot of nondescript buildings separated by wide, paved roads and rows of planes on the flight line. But the mission here is different, and so is the complex situated in one corner of the base. There's a manicured garden with wooden benches; a meditation pavilion with a big fountain and a skylight.

And here, most importantly, is the Center for the Families of the Fallen. Mirrors and framed landscapes decorate the walls. Overstuffed couches are arranged with coffee tables and chairs.

This is where families gather and wait for the planes that are carrying their loved ones.

Sgt. Sean Finley, chaplain assistant

The toughest part of Finley's job happens here. At the height of the wars, it was normal to have several families at a time. Many of those families included small children.

""So in here is the children's room,"" Finley says, giving the tour. ""The kids can come in here and color and play. But of course, the big highlight is the chalkboard wall.""

The staff erases the board when it gets filled up with messages from the hundreds of kids who have passed through here.

""We'll usually leave something up on the wall — a flower or a cat or a saying,"" he says. ""At the very top, 'Our hero for always,' that was written up there almost a year ago, but nobody's gone and written up above it, so we just kind of leave it up there.""

Finley, who has worked here since 2012, says he feels like he's making a difference for military families still reeling from shock over their loss. At the same time, he has had to create a kind of distance for himself.

""I knew that if I internalized everything that came through, I would overflow,"" he says. ""So I try and take care of the families the best I can and be there. If I can engage with them I do, and listen to their stories, and there's some great stories that I've been told. There's some terrible stories that I've been told, but those stories belong to those people. They don't belong to me, and so I don't keep them.""

Mel Spera, funeral director and embalmer 

Spera was in the military years ago. We meet her in a cavernous warehouse with row after row of caskets stacked up behind her. When fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq was at its worst, Sparrow says 20 or 30 bodies came a day.

Now that the ground wars have ended, Spera and her team spend most of their time going over procedures again and again. There is no margin for error, she says.

""We cannot have something like a name mispelled, middle initial missing or the wrong letter, or basically anything, because if the family sees that they're going to go, 'They didn't take care of my baby. How do I know that's my baby?' "" she says. ""That kind of questioning goes into anger in a heartbeat a flash.""

Jim Parsons, mortuary technician

Parsons, who has worked here in and out of uniform since 1985, says it's hard to accurately describe what it's like at Dover.

""I could sit here and talk to you all day long, but you still — it would be hard for you to understand,"" he says. ""That's just the way it is. I talk to my wife all day long. She doesn't always get it. We've been married for 20 years.""

David Sparks, chaplain

There's a lot of talk at Dover Air Force base about resiliency. Staff members are required to attend at least two so-called ""resiliency sessions"" a week. On top of that, Sparks holds voluntary sessions called pizza and conversation. No one has to go — but they do and not just for the free pizza.

Sparks says what preoccupies a lot of the military personnel here is just the regular stuff of life.

""What's happening at home, what's happening with their kids or their spouse. What's happening with the next assignment,"" he says. ""Not the trauma of what they do and the emotional impact of that. What's mostly on their mind is what's at home.""

But for many like Sparks, who have been at Dover through the worst of it, the grief is always there.

""Most often, it's on the flight line when it gets to me,"" he says. ""It's the mother who is wailing, in a biblical sense. There's this wail that comes from the gut level. It takes me to the ground every time.""

Fathers too, Sparks says.

""I've heard that wail from a father, and the picture in my mind is the father of a Marine, and the transfer case has come off the plane and it's been put into the vehicle. It's been closed up. We've saluted. And the vehicle starts to pull off and the honor guard is marching behind. And this guy reaches out — I can see it — he just reaches out like this, and he just screams, for his son.""

Each fallen service member receives a dignified transfer at Dover, which means that every time the casket is moved, it happens deliberately, with precision and honor.

Master Sgt. Enid Ellis

Despite the gravity of this place, what is striking is how much the people here love what they do. Ellis is on her 14th tour of duty at Dover. What keeps pulling her back? Joy, she says.

""We believe in what we're doing here,"" she says. ""It has touched me, and it continues to. I want people to understand that even though their aunt, their cousin, their uncle, their daughter, their son have sacrificed for us; we love them. We love them, even though they're not physically here. We take care of them, because we do love them.""

And so they practice the ritual of bringing them home.

"This story was co-published by NPR and ProPublica.

Four days after Marie McCausland delivered her first child in May, she knew something was very wrong. She had intense pain in her upper chest, her blood pressure was rising, and she was so swollen that she barely recognized herself in the mirror. As she curled up in bed that evening, a scary thought flickered through her exhausted brain: ""If I go to sleep right now, I don't know if I'm gonna be waking up.""

What she didn't have was good information about what might be wrong. The discharge materials the hospital sent home with her were vague and confusing — ""really quite useless,"" she said. Then she remembered a ProPublica/NPR story she had read recently about a New Jersey nurse who died soon after childbirth.

The nurse, Lauren Bloomstein, had developed severe preeclampsia, a dangerous type of hypertension that often happens during the second half of pregnancies — and can also emerge after the baby is delivered, when it often is overlooked, accounting for dozens of maternal deaths a year. McCausland realized that she might have preeclampsia, too.

The 27-year-old molecular virologist and her husband bundled up their newborn son and raced to the nearest emergency room in Cleveland. The ER doctor told her that she was feeling normal postpartum symptoms, she said, and wanted to send her home even as her blood pressure hovered at perilous heights. Several hours passed before he consulted with an ob/gyn at another hospital and McCausland's severe preeclampsia was treated with magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures.

Without Bloomstein's story as a warning, McCausland doubts she would have recognized her symptoms or persisted in the face of the ER doctor's dismissive approach.

""I had just come home with the baby and really didn't want to go back to the hospital. I think I probably would have just wrote it off."" In that case, she said, ""I don't know if I'd be here. I really don't.""

McCausland's experience is far from unique. In the months since ProPublica and NPR launched our project about maternal deaths and near-deaths in the U.S., we've heard from 3,100 women who endured life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth complications, often suffering long-lasting physical and emotional effects.

(Tell us your story)

The Leapfrog Group provides performance data on more than 1,800 hospitals and publishes an annual Maternity Care Report.

Consumer Reports offers  C-section data from more than 1,300 hospitals by ZIP code.

The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative's ""toolkits"" of protocols to treat life-threatening obstetric complications include infographics, checklists and lengthy backup materials but require (free) registration for access.

The Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health's ""bundles"" offer similar information in a condensed, easily downloadable form.

The Health4Mom site, from the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, has a ""Save Your Life"" campaign, including a one-page checklist, to help new mothers recognize postpartum warning signs.

The Institute for Perinatal Quality Improvement offers these resources for medical professionals.

Childbirth Connection provides evidence-based information on maternity care. The Preeclampsia Foundation's ""Wonder Woman"" posts (here and here) put the U.S. maternal mortality numbers in context and offer more strategies for self-advocacy.

Postpartum Support International offers many resources for women with pregnancy-related depression, anxiety and mood disorders.

Facebook is a gathering place for thousands of women who've experienced life-threatening complications, but many groups are condition-specific and/or closed to nonsurvivors. One open group worth checking out: The Unexpected Project.

Social justice groups are also becoming active around the issue of maternal deaths and near-deaths, with a focus on why African-American women are disproportionately affected. They include the Black Mamas Matter Alliance and Moms Rising.

The same themes that run though McCausland's story echo many of these survivors' recollections. They frequently told us they had known little to nothing about the complications that nearly killed them. Even when the women were convinced something was terribly amiss, doctors and nurses were sometimes slow to believe them. Mothers especially lacked information about risks in the postpartum period, when medical care is often disjointed or difficult to access and the baby is the focus of attention.

""Every single nurse, pediatrician and lactation consultant dismissed my concerns as hormones and anxiety,"" wrote Emily McLaughlin, who suffered a stroke and other complications after giving birth in Connecticut in 2015.

Hospitals, medical organizations and maternal safety groups are introducing a host of initiatives aimed at educating expectant and new mothers and improving how providers respond to emergencies. But as McCausland's experience illustrates, self-advocacy is also critically important.

We asked survivors: What can people do to ensure that what happened to Lauren Bloomstein doesn't happen to them or their loved ones? How can they help prevent situations like Marie McCausland's from spiraling out of control? What do they wish they had known ahead of their severe complications? What made a difference in their recovery? How did they get medical professionals to listen? Here is a selection of their insights, in their own words.

""A lot of data on specific doctors and hospitals can be found publicly. Knowing how your physician and hospital rates as compared to others (cesarean rates, infection rates, readmission rates) can give you valuable insight into how they perform. 'Liking' your doctor as a person is nice, but not nearly as important as their and their facility's culture and track record.""— Kristen Terlizzi, 35, survived a placenta accreta (a disorder in which the placenta grows into or through the uterine wall) in 2014, co-founder of the National Accreta Foundation 

""Key pieces of information every woman should know before choosing a hospital are: What are their safety protocols for adverse maternal events? No one likes to think about this while pregnant, and providers will probably tell you that it's unlikely to happen. But it does happen, and it's good to know that the hospital and providers have practiced for such scenarios and have proper protocols in place.""— Marianne Drexler, 39, survived a hemorrhage and emergency hysterectomy in 2014

""Ask your doctors if they have ever experienced a case of an amniotic fluid embolism [an abnormal response to amniotic fluid entering the mother's bloodstream] or other severe event themselves. If a birthing center is your choice, discuss what happens in an emergency — how far away is the closest hospital with an ICU? Because a lot of hospitals don't have them. Another thing many women don't realize is that not every hospital has an obstetrician there 24/7. Ask your doctors: If they're not able to be there the whole time you're in labor, will there be another OB-GYN on-site 24 hours a day if something goes wrong?""— Miranda Klassen, 41, survived amniotic fluid embolism in 2008, founder/executive director of the Amniotic Fluid Embolism Foundation

""While my doctor was amazing, we live in a smaller town and [the hospital didn't] carry enough blood/platelets on hand for very emergent situations. They have patients shipped to larger hospitals when they need more care. Had I been aware of that, we would have decided to deliver at a larger hospital so in case something happened to me or our daughter, we wouldn't be separated — which we were when I was life-flighted out.""— Kristina Landrus, 26, survived a hemorrhage in 2013 

""My best advice for getting a medical professional to listen is to keep searching for one that is willing to listen. Because of my insurance and personal circumstances at the time, I felt I had no option but to take whoever my providers [assigned] me, despite several red flags even before my delivery. I was not aware of my right to change providers until it was too late.""— Joy Huff, 39, survived a blood infection in 2013

""A conversation about possible things that could go wrong is prudent to have with your doctor or in one of these childbirth classes. I don't think that it needs to be done in a way to terrify the new parents, but as a way to provide knowledge. The pregnant woman should be taught warning signs and know when to speak up so that she can be treated as quickly and accurately as possible.""— Susan Lewis, 33, survived multiple blood clots and severe hemorrhage in 2016

""Always have somebody with you in a medical setting to ask the questions you might not think of and to advocate on your behalf if your ability to communicate is compromised by being in poor health. ... And get emotional support to steel you against the naysayers. It may feel really unnatural or difficult to push back [against doctors and nurses]. Online forums and Facebook groups can be helpful to ensure you're not losing your mind.""— Eleni Tsigas, survived preeclampsia in 1998 and 1999, executive director of the Preeclampsia Foundation

""Know your rights. Know what kind of decisions you might have to make and what you want to do before you go. Doctors and nurses are there to make quick decisions — they're not worried about how you will feel about it afterward. They are worried about a lawsuit, whether they can get you stable quickly so they can move on. I'm not saying they are heartless — far from it, my mother is a nurse, I know what sort of heart goes into that profession. But they have a lot to do and a lot to worry about. Your feelings are not at the top of that list. At least not as far as they are concerned in the moment.""— Carrie Anthony, 36, survived two pregnancies with placenta accreta and hemorrhage in 2008 and 2015 

""It isn't just important to know how you feel about blood transfusions and life-saving measures — you have to communicate these things to your spouse or family member. I was given six blood transfusions, but I was barely conscious when asked if I wanted them. Of course I wanted any life-saving measures, but my husband should have been consulted, given that I was not of a clear mind.""— Rachel Stuhler, 36, survived a hemorrhage in 2017

""In case you ever are unable to respond, someone needs to step in and be your voice! Know as much thorough medical history as possible, and let your spouse or support person know [in depth] your history as well."" — Kristina Landrus

""Also be sure your spouse and your other family members, like your parents or siblings, are on the same page about your care. And if you aren't married, who will be making the decisions on your behalf? You should put things in order, designate the person who will be the decisionmaker and give that person power of attorney. Other important things to have are a medical directive or a living will — be sure to bring a copy with you to the hospital. I also recommend packing a journal to record everything that happens.""— Miranda Klassen

""Make a list of your questions and make sure you get the full answer. I went to every appointment the second time around with a notebook. I would apologize for being 'that patient,' but I had been through this before and I wasn't going to be confused again. I wanted to know everything. Honestly, it was as harmful as it was helpful — I knew what I was getting into, which made it much scarier. The first time, my ignorance was bliss. I didn't realize I almost died until two weeks after I had left the hospital. I didn't even start researching what had happen to me until months later. The second time I was an advocate for myself. Medical journals and support groups were a part of every single visit. And thankfully I was in good hands.""— Carrie Anthony

""Write down what each specialty says to you. When I was hospitalized for six weeks prior to giving birth, I was visited two to three times a week by someone from each department that would be involved in my life-saving surgery. This means that I saw someone from the neonatal intensive care unit as well as reps from gynecologic oncology, maternal fetal medicine, interventional radiology, and anesthesiology. They paraded in on a schedule, checked up on me, asked if I had any questions. I always did, but I regret not writing down what each said each time (along with names!). I got so many different answers regarding how I would be anesthetized, and on the day it all had to happen in an emergency, there were disagreements above me in the O.R. between the specialists. It was like children arguing on a playground, and my life was in danger. Had I kept a more vigilant record of what each specialty reported to me, perhaps prior to the day I could have confronted each with the details that weren't matching up.""— Megan Moody, 36, survived placenta percreta (when the placenta penetrates through the uterine wall) in 2016

""People should know that they have a right to ask for more time with the doctor or more followup if they feel something is not right. The OB-GYNs (at least in Pennsylvania) are so busy, and sometimes appointments are quite quick and rushed. Make the doctors slow down and take the time with you.""— Dani Leiman, 37, survived HELLP syndrome (a particularly dangerous variant of preeclampsia) in 2011  ""You have a legal right to your medical records throughout pregnancy and anytime afterwards. Get a copy of your lab results each time blood is drawn, and a copy of your prenatal and hospital reports. Ask about concerning or unclear results.""— Eleni Tsigas

""Understand the system. Ask a nurse or a trusted loved one in the 'industry' how it all works. I've found that medical professionals are more likely to listen to you if you demonstrate an understanding of their roles and the kind of questions they can/cannot answer. Know your 'silos.' Don't ask an anesthesiologist how they plan on stitching up your cervix. Specialists are often incredibly impatient. You need to get the details out of them regarding their very specific roles.""— Megan Moody 

""Let doctors know you care about your health and safety as much as they do. Tell them you want to be a partner in your health care. Do not act as an adversary to your doctor."" — Tricia Fitzgerald, 40, survived a hemorrhage caused by severe preeclampsia in 2014

""First you have to be armed with concrete knowledge with examples about your illness and have a firm attitude. This is why it is important to know your body. Do your research before your appointment, but make it personal. Do not present your case as if you just went on WebMD for the information. Create a log of your health activities. This log should contain all illnesses you are concerned about, when they occurred and how did you feel. Have your questions and concerns written down. You should always carry a list of your medications, dosage and milligrams. Include any side effects. Ask concrete questions and have the doctors present their findings to you in a language you can understand. If you do not agree [with what one doctor tells you], ask another doctor. Remember, knowledge is power and you must have that power.""— Anner Porter, 55, survived postpartum cardiomyopathy in 1992, founder of the advocacy organization Fight PPCM

""If your provider tells you, 'you are pregnant, what you're experiencing is normal,' remember — that may be true. [But it's also true] that preeclampsia can mimic many normal symptoms of pregnancy. Ask 'what else could this be?' Expect a thoughtful answer that includes consideration of 'differential diagnoses' — in other words, other conditions that could be causing the same symptoms."" — Eleni Tsigas

""Crying! I'm only slightly kidding. I truly think the only way to get them to listen is to be adamant and don't back down. I had a situation where I felt no one was paying attention to me, and I cried out of frustration over the phone. Then they listened to me and snapped into action.""

— Dani Leiman

""So many women do speak up about the strange pain they have, and a nurse may brush it off as normal without consulting a doctor and running any tests. Be annoying if you must — this is your life. ... Thankfully, I never had to be so assertive. I owe my life to the team of doctors and nurses who acted swiftly and accurately, and I am eternally grateful.""— Susan Lewis

""If you have a hemorrhage, don't clean up after yourself! Make sure the doctor is fully aware of how much blood you are losing. I had a very nice nurse who was helping to keep me clean and helping to change my (rapidly filling) pads. If the doctor had seen the pools of blood himself, rather than just being told about them, he might not have been so quick to dismiss me.""—Valerie Bradford, 30, survived hemorrhage in 2016

Paying attention to your symptoms

""I had heard of preeclampsia but I was naïve — [I believed] that it was something women developed who didn't watch what they ate and didn't focus on good health prior and/or during pregnancy. I was in great health and shape prior to getting pregnant, during my pregnancy, I continued to make good food choices and worked out up until 36 hours before the baby had to be taken. I gained healthy weight and kept my BMI at an optimum number. I thought due to my good health, I was not susceptible to anything and my labor would be easy. So although I had felt bad for 1 1/2 weeks, I chalked it up to the fact that I was almost 8 months into this pregnancy, so you're not supposed to feel great. ... I walked into my doctor's office that Friday and not one hour later, I was in an emergency C-section delivering a baby. I had to fully be put under, due to the severity of the HELLP, so I didn't wake up until the next day.""— Kelli Davis, 31, survived HELLP syndrome in 2016 

""Understand that severe, sustained pain is not normal. So many people told me that the final trimester of pregnancy is sooo uncomfortable. It was my first pregnancy, I have a generally high threshold for pain, and my son was breech so I thought his head was causing bad pain under my ribs [when it was really epigastric pain from the HELLP syndrome]. I kept thinking it was normal to be in pain, and I let it go until it was almost too late.""— Dani Leiman

""I wish I would have known what high blood pressure numbers were. I had a pharmacist take my blood pressure at a pharmacy and let me walk out the door with a blood pressure of 210/102. She acted like it was no big deal ('it's a little high'), and so I believed her. Even after telling my husband, we really thought nothing of it."" — Melissa McFadden, 36, survived preeclampsia in 2013 

""Know the way your blood pressure should be taken. And ask for the results. Politely challenge the technician or nurse if it's not being done correctly or if they suggest 'changing positions to get a lower reading.' Very high blood pressure (anything over 160/110) is a 'hypertensive crisis' and requires immediate intervention."" — Eleni Tsigas

""Please ask for a heart monitor for yourself while in labor, not just for the baby. I think if I had one on, seconds or minutes could have been erased from reaction time by the nurses. They were alerted to an issue because the baby's heart stopped during labor, and while the nurse was checking that machine, my husband noticed I was also non-responsive. That's when everything happened (cardiac arrest due to AFE).""— Kristy Kummer-Pred, 44, survived amniotic fluid embolism and cardiac arrest in 2012 

""My swelling in my hands and feet never went away. My uterus hadn't shrunk. I wasn't bleeding that bad, but there was a strange odor to it. My breasts were swollen and my milk wasn't coming in. I was misdiagnosed with mastitis [a painful inflammation of the breast tissue that sometimes occurs when milk ducts become plugged and engorged]. The real problem was that I still had pieces of placenta inside my uterus. Know that your placenta should not come out in multiple pieces. It should come out in one piece. If it is broken apart, demand an ultrasound to ensure the doctors got it all. If you have flu-like symptoms, demand to be seen by a doctor. If you don't like your doctor, demand another one.""— Brandi Miller, 32, survived placenta accreta and hemorrhage in 2015

""There is a period in the days and weeks after delivery where your blood pressure can escalate and you can have a seizure, stroke or heart attack, even well after a healthy birth. You should take your own blood pressure at home if your doctor doesn't tell you to. ... Unfortunately, I went home from [all my postpartum] appointments with my blood pressure so high that I started having a brain hemorrhage. Not one single person ever thought of taking my blood pressure when I was complaining about my discomfort and showing telltale warning signs of [preeclampsia].""— Emily McLaughlin

""The ER doctor that I had was not treating me as a postpartum case. He was just thinking of me as a 27-year-old with high blood pressure. I think, if you have the opportunity, the ideal thing would be to go back to the same hospital where you had your baby, because they have a labor and delivery unit and they have your records. But if the closest emergency room isn't at the hospital where you delivered, then you have to be more vigilant. Make sure they know you just gave birth. If you know something is wrong with you, don't take no for an answer. Just keep saying, 'I think this is something serious' and don't let them discharge you, especially if it's someone who isn't familiar with pregnant women.""— Marie McCausland

""The postpartum period is when a lot of pregnancy-related heart problems like cardiomyopathy emerge. If there is still difficulty breathing, fluid buildup in ankles, shortness of breath and you are unable to lie flat on your back, go see a cardiologist ASAP. If you have to go to an emergency room, request to have the following tests performed: echocardiogram (echo) test, ejection fraction test, B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP), EKG test and chest X-ray test. These tests will determine if your heart is failing and will save your life.""— Anner Porter

""Rest as much as possible — for as long as possible. Being in too big a rush to get 'back to normal' can exacerbate postpartum health risks. Things that are not normal: heavy bleeding longer than 6 weeks or bleeding that stops and starts again, not producing milk, fevers, severe pain (especially around incision sites), excessive fatigue, and anxiety/depression. If you don't feel like yourself, get help.""— Amy Barron Smolinski, 37, survived preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage and other complications in three pregnancies in 2006, 2011 and 2012; executive director of Mom2Mom Global, a breastfeeding support group

""Know that your preexisting health conditions may be impacted by having a baby (hormone changes, sleep deprivation, stress). Record your health and your baby's in a journal or app to track any changes. Reach out to the nurse or doctor when there are noticeable changes that you have tracked.""— Noelle Garcia, 33, survived placental abruption (placenta separating from the uterine wall during pregnancy) in 2007

""If your hospital discharges you on tons of Motrin or painkillers, be aware that this can mask the warning signs of headache, which is sometimes the only warning sign of preeclampsia coming on postpartum.""—Emily McLaughlin 

""I wish I had known that postpartum PTSD was possible. Most people associate PTSD with the effects of war, but I was diagnosed with PTSD after my traumatic birth and near-death experience. Almost 6 years later, I still experience symptoms sporadically."" — Meagan Raymer, 31, survived severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome in 2011

""I recommend therapy with a female therapist specializing in trauma. Honestly, I avoided it for 8 months. I was then in therapy for 12 months. I still have ongoing anxiety ... but I would be in a very bad place (potentially depression and self-harm due to self-blame) were it not for therapy. It was so hard to admit [what was happening]. I started to get a suspicion when I heard an NPR story about a veteran with PTSD. I thought ... that sounds like me. And I started Googling.""— Jessica Rae Hoffman, 28, survived severe sepsis and other complications in 2015 

""The emotional constructs our society puts around pregnancy and childbirth make the ideas of severe injury and death taboo. Childbirth is a messy, traumatic experience. ... Many women don't seek care even when they instinctively believe something is wrong because they're supposed to 'be happy.' Awareness and transparency are so important."" — Leah Soule, 33, survived a hemorrhage in 2015 

""Having an incredible support network made the greatest impact with my near-death experience, but my family and friends needed their own support as they coped. My mom didn't leave my side, but she also had a team of friends supporting her so that she could let her guard down and cry when she needed to do so. My husband was at my bedside or with the baby constantly that first week, but he was also suffering from the trauma of everything and was having a really hard time coping and needed to leave the hospital environment. My best friend is an ICU nurse and quickly became the person everyone asked clarifying questions, but she didn't want to be a nurse in that moment but rather someone who was scared for her friend.""— Susan Lewis

""I wish I had understood how significant the impact was on my husband. Emotionally, the experience was much more difficult and long-lasting for him than for me, and it continued to affect his relationship with both me and our baby for quite a while, at a time when I didn't think it was a thing at all.""— Elizabeth Venstra, 44, survived HELLP syndrome in 2014

""I would suggest establishing yourself ahead of time with a doula or midwife that can make postpartum visits to your home, which can promote health even if everything goes smoothly. Many communities have those services available if you can't afford them. [A doula] wasn't covered through our insurance, but the social worker at the hospital arranged for someone paid for by [San Diego County] to come and do several checks on me and my son, which was very reassuring to both my husband and me.""— Miranda Klassen

""If you're given a diagnosis of a life-threatening pregnancy complication, line up a therapist immediately so can start getting the support you need as soon as you give birth. Don't wait until your six-week [postpartum] appointment when they do a depression screen and you realize you're not coping well. You'll have to wait at least another week for the appointment to be made. Why not have that in place? I wish I did.""— Megan Moody 

""Don't assume everyone gets it. Don't assume everyone wants to hear it. My story is scary. Some soon-to-be moms have looked horrified by my story. Some already moms have been scared away by it. Most people are happy to listen, like to be informed, but some do not. Some people are happier thinking, 'It's all going to be OK, not me, I'll be fine.' They should at least know, but that's their choice. You can't force people to open their eyes. Be there. Offer help. But don't force it.""— Carrie Anthony

"""I hope you're having a meaningful day.""

That might be one of the better things to say to a veteran this Monday. You should probably avoid the common refrain, ""Thank you for your service,"" according to someone who should know.

""On Memorial Day, the veteran you're talking to may be going through a bit of melancholy remembering people who died over the years,"" says Navy veteran Luke Visconti, who also co-founded the website DiversityInc, which wrote about the subject recently.

As most people are aware (or should be), Memorial Day and Veterans Day serve different purposes.

Veterans Day is to honor the service of people who have worn the uniforms of the armed forces.

Memorial Day is intended to remember those who died while serving.

Visconti encourages those who want to say supportive words to a veteran to recognize ""that the person may have friends who died in combat.""

As far as saying thank you goes, ""I don't need to be thanked for my service,"" he tells NPR's Michel Martin. ""I think it's become kind of a platitude, toss-away thing to say.""

Memorial Day and Veterans Day have separate origins going back to two different wars: the Civil War and World War I.

Shortly after the Civil War, Memorial Day began as Decoration Day. ""The reason for that is because it was a day on which Americans, South and in the North, would decorate the graves of soldiers who died in the Civil War,"" history professor Matthew Dennis told NPR in 2005. It was a ""vernacular, grassroots kind of expression of mourning.""

Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, who headed a group for Union veterans, declared in 1868 that Decoration Day would be observed on May 30. According to a Memorial Day history from the Department of Veterans Affairs, after World War I the holiday was broadened to include service members who died in all of the country's wars, not just the Civil War.

Multiple cities claim to be the birthplace of the holiday, but President Lyndon Johnson formally gave the honor to Waterloo, N.Y., in 1966. An act of Congress in 1971 switched the observance to the last Monday in May, the VA notes.

Veterans Day, on the other hand, was originally called Armistice Day, which commemorated the end of fighting in World War I — you may have heard before that it happened on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, in 1918.

President Woodrow Wilson celebrated the first Armistice Day in 1919. In 1938, November 11 became a legal holiday by an act of Congress, and in 1954 it was changed from ""Armistice"" to ""Veterans"" Day, in order to honor all veterans.

So save the thanks for Veterans Day, if you must. ""I think sometimes maybe just a pat on the back or an arm around the shoulder is really better than words,"" Visconti says. ""So just be a friend.""

"Updated on Nov. 3 at 11:04 a.m. E.D.T.

President Donald Trump said ""I don't remember much"" about a March 2016 meeting at which a foreign policy adviser proposed setting up a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It was a very unimportant meeting, took place a long time ago,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before he boarded a helicopter for his trip to Asia.

That March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump's campaign team has taken on new importance this week after prosecutors disclosed that a young adviser at the table had pleaded guilty to making false statements about the nature of his contacts with Russians last year.

That former adviser, George Papadopoulos, has agreed to cooperate with investigators working for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.

Also at the table in March 2016 was now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At his confirmation hearing this year, Sessions denied having contacts with Russians during the campaign. Senate Democrats including Al Franken of Minnesota, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have accused Sessions of lying under oath.

On Thursday, the Democrats demanded that Sessions return to the Senate to answer new questions about his contacts as a top surrogate for Trump, and contradictions in his testimony this year.

Leahy said Sessions' prior accounts are ""impossible to reconcile"" with court papers unsealed this week.

But Republicans, who control the Senate and the Judiciary Committee, probably have little appetite to grill the attorney general of their own political party. Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has not scheduled any new hearing.

The criticism of Sessions is taking place at a sensitive time for the attorney general: Trump has spent the last day using Twitter and impromptu media sessions to beat up on the legal arm of his own administration.

""I""m really not involved with the Justice Department,"" he said on Friday morning. ""I'd like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats ... A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department including me.""

Trump also has tweeted that he wants the DOJ and the FBI to launch an investigation into his political opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has criticized James Comey, the FBI director he fired in May under questionable circumstances.

And he urged prosecutors to take a look at Anthony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist who stepped aside from his firm, The Podesta Group, earlier this week after court documents suggested Mueller's office was investigating his work on behalf of Ukraine.

Another onetime Trump campaign leader connected to the Papadopoulos guilty plea is Sam Clovis, who denied wrongdoing but announced he would withdraw from a position at the Department of Agriculture in advance of his November 9 confirmation hearing.

The public remarks from the commander in chief break with decades-old traditions dating back to the post-Watergate period, when officials from both political parties demanded the Justice Department be insulated from political pressure from the White House.

""This isn't a partisan issue,"" said Matthew Axelrod, who served in the Justice Department under Democratic and Republican presidents and now works at the firm Linklaters. ""Everyone who cares about the institution should be up in arms.""

On Thursday, Trump told an interviewer at WMAL radio in Washington that he was ""very frustrated"" by constraints on his ability to influence the federal law enforcement process.

""But you know, the saddest thing is that, because I'm the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department,"" Trump said. ""I'm not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I'm not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing.""

Nonetheless, Trump has continued to decry the ongoing special counsel probe as a ""witch hunt,"" even as Mueller's team took first public actions this week. On Friday morning, Trump told reporters, ""All I can tell you is this: there was no collusion, there was no nothing. It's a disgrace, frankly, that they continue.""

The pattern of public statements from the president, who also called for the execution of a suspect accused in the New York City truck attack this week, does not surprise critics of his administration.

Last year, even before the election, legal analysts and Justice Department veterans warned that Trump might have little respect for the department's traditions.

But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein this week used a lecture at the federal courthouse in Washington —the same building where Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges — to hail the president's respect for the rule of law.

In responding to audience questions, Rosenstein highlighted a case against the former police chief in Bordentown Township, New Jersey. The retired chief, Frank Nucera Jr., is accused of violating the civil rights of a black civilian, including slamming the person's head into a metal door jamb and causing a ""loud thud.""

Rosenstein described the prosecution as evidence of the Justice Department's commitment to prosecuting law-breaking by police.

Left unmentioned, however, was Trump's July speech in New York at which he told law enforcement officials not to go easy on suspects when they are arrested.

""Please don't be too nice,"" the president said.

"A long-simmering fight is back on this week over the role of the infamous Donald Trump dossier after a new report that confirmed that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign helped fund it.

The battle over the unverified dossier is a crucial front in the broader political fight over the Trump White House, the public's perceptions of the president and his stunning election win.

The DNC and Clinton campaign's role in funding the dossier, which was reported by the Washington Post, doesn't add much to what was already public. It's been understood for months that the research that went into the document was initially underwritten by Trump's Republican opponents during the GOP primary season, and later taken over by Democrats during the general election campaign.

Still, the president and his supporters have seized on the new details about the DNC-Clinton role to push their view that the various Russia investigations — from Capitol Hill to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller — are based on a fraudulent, politically inspired hit job.

In short, they argue, if the dossier is the case that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia's attack on the election, that means there's no case.

Citing Fox News, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, ""Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President.""

""Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President."" @FoxNews

He later repeated to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House his sometime theory that the Russia collusion story is a Democratic hoax.

The president's allies have also taken up the message.

Erick Erickson, a conservative blogger and radio host, wrote that ""both the DNC campaign apparatus and the Democratic leader, Barack Obama via his FBI, tried to dig up dirt on Trump.""

""This should all be kept in mind as the Democrats continue to claim Russia stole the election and that Donald Trump has all sorts of nefarious ties to Russia,"" he added. ""Many of those claims, now, appear to really have been generated in an incestuous relationship of sore losers.""

For months, Republicans on the Hill have been trying to discover who specifically was behind the dossier. Its author is known, revealed as the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who compiled the material for an American political investigation firm called Fusion GPS.

Political campaigns routinely pay outfits like Fusion GPS to generate ""opposition research"" on their adversaries. In this case, the desire to learn more about Trump's connections to Russia began with one of his primary opponents in 2016.

The identity of that campaign hasn't been confirmed, but Trump suggested on Wednesday he might know it. 

Later — presumably after the initial Republican sponsor's campaign ended with Trump's victory in a primary — Democrats and Clinton's campaign began paying Fusion GPS to keep up its work, according to the Post. The FBI also is said to have paid Steele, although it cut off its relationship with him after his name became public.

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has pushed the FBI for an explanation about how it used the dossier in its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, which is probing Russia's election role, have done so as well.

""It is relevant who paid for the dossier. It is much more relevant who relied upon it,"" Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told Fox News on Wednesday. ""So I want to know whether the nation's premier law enforcement agency relied on a document that looks like the National Enquirer prepared it.""

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has gone over the heads of the panel's Democrats to subpoena Fusion GPS's bank records, which would likely show who paid for the research.

Fusion GPS has resisted, but a federal judge in Washington, D.C., is expected to rule on the matter soon.

For as much attention as the salacious dossier has gotten, there is wealth of public reporting that has confirmed certain elements in the document and a host of other things about ties between people in the Trump orbit and Russia.

The founding document of the FBI probe, now led by special counsel Mueller, is not the Steele dossier but the U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment from January 2016. That document lays out the intelligence community's view that Russia conducted a multifaceted influence operation to undermine American democracy, damage Clinton and help Trump win.

In May, Gowdy asked former CIA Director John Brennan whether his agency had relied on the unverified dossier in forming its conclusions about the Russian influence campaign. No, Brennan told him.

""It wasn't part of the corpus of intelligence information that we had,"" Brennan said. ""It was not in any way used as a basis for the intelligence community assessment that was done.""

The Kremlin campaign included hacking the DNC's computer systems, releasing pilfered communications to WikiLeaks to publish them, and a sophisticated overt propaganda and disinformation campaign.

The scale of the Russian efforts has come into focus in recent weeks as social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have revealed how Moscow's minions used their platforms to try to influence Americans and amplify divisions in U.S. society.

Public reporting has also nailed down multiple high-level contacts between people within the Trump orbit and Russians. And business contacts were not limited to those in Trump's immediate orbit. His own company, the Trump Organization, was in talks in January of 2016 about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.

Trump's longtime personal lawyer and a senior executive in the company, Michael Cohen, acknowledged emailing Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman to try to enlist his support with the stalled project.

Cohen said he ultimately abandoned the proposal for what he said were business reasons. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The fight over the dossier has helped contributed to the unraveling of the House Intelligence Committee's Russia probe as well as a similar investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But two Russia investigations continue to forge ahead — that of the Senate Intelligence Committee and that of Mueller's.

"On an island eight miles off Puerto Rico's coast, homes sit destroyed on hillsides and many of its nearly 9,000 residents still wait for federal aid. Vieques' hospital is operating out of tents in a parking lot.  And the island is facing the prospect of six more months without electricity from Puerto Rico's main grid.  

The island's bleak trajectory epitomizes the unevenness of the disaster relief effort in the hurricane-devastated U.S. territory, where metropolitan areas such as San Juan are showing clear signs of recovery.

At Vieques' bar La Nasa, couples sway on a dance floor to the beats of a generator-powered stereo system. A bartender pulls beers out of a cooler. The original bar was reduced to rubble from the hurricane and washed into the sea. 

""It was a mess! A big mess,"" laughs owner José Silva, standing in the sand. The new bar is a colorful rickety patio next to a pile of debris, the wreckage of the original. Silva says that after the hurricane, he scavenged wood to reconstruct the small bar and opened within a week.

""You know people they was stressed out, they was so sad that the place was gone, they just wanted to come and cry,"" Silva adds.  

Cut off from power

The storm cut Vieques off from Puerto Rico's main electrical grid. A new holiday song for the upcoming Epiphany celebration is playing on this night, with a gift request. It goes, I'll ask the three kings to bring a new generator.

That message resonates here, where there's vocal frustration about the island's troubled main generator station, meant to provide power to Vieques residents when the connection to the main grid is down. That generator is riddled with problems. 

""You can ask any resident of Vieques and they will tell you that that generator doesn't work, that it's a piece of junk,"" says Haronid Cruz Felix, the animated spokesperson for the mayor. 

At that generator station on a recent morning, red lights flashed on the control board. Carlos Perez, the operator of the generator, says it finally started working five days before, after months without power. 

But on this recent morning Vieques was totally without power again, after a new problem arose a few hours earlier, causing the system to shut down. Perez works for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, also known as PREPA. Residents say the generator is now providing some service to a limited number of buildings. 

Perez says there are a lot of reasons for the generator's problems. It uses French parts that are difficult to replace and they don't store spares. ""If you don't have parts when things break down, you don't have a generator,"" he says. And it uses hundreds of gallons of diesel hourly, which can be difficult to transport to the remote island. Plus, the power lines and poles in Vieques are damaged, limiting the number of homes that electricity can flow to even when the generator is working.

Felix says he's frustrated by a lack of communication from PREPA. ""The only date that we have been given for Vieques to have regular power is between March and May,"" he says. The utility did not respond to requests for comment – Perez, the generator operator, said simply that restoring regular power from the grid system that runs underwater from the main island of Puerto Rico to Vieques is ""going to take some time.""

There's a lot of blame going around for the plight of Vieques. The mayor's spokesman says the electricity company, the Puerto Rican government, and the federal government all played a role. Like many here, he feels the island has been marginalized at many levels of government. Many of the residents here also believe the mayor has not responded with enough urgency to the situation.

The island was used for decades as a training ground for the U.S. military, including bombing exercises – a fact that Felix believes should mean more effective assistance from the federal government. ""Sixty years bombarding these lands and the government has not even been able to get a power generator up and running? It's on that level,"" he says.

Still in crisis mode

The island didn't have regular running water for a nearly month, until generators were secured specifically to operate the pump, Felix adds. 

Not having electricity for months is time-consuming. Seventy-seven year old Juan Santos, taking a walk on the beach with his wife, says he has to go to the grocery store and purchase food daily or else it will spoil. ""What you find in the stores, sometimes you don't like what you buy but you have to eat it!"" he laughs, sounding tired. 

Cell service is patchy and shifting, far worse than metropolitan areas such as San Juan. ""I think it's just ludicrous that in this day and age we don't have communications and we still don't have electricity,"" says Gladys Aleman, who co-owns a Vieques-based ecotourism company. ""We were two, three weeks after Maria and we still couldn't make a phone call. I still can't call, I can't text ... I blame everybody. This is crazy to me."" She says it's impossible to operate a business without communications.

""We are still in crisis mode,"" Aleman adds.

Tourism had been a growing industry on this beautiful island, where horses wander on lush hillsides and bioluminescent sea life glows in the water. Since the storm, tourism has dried up. The largest hotel and the island's second-largest employer, the W Vieques Island, is closed through Dec. 2018. 

'This is how I suture'

The vulnerability of Vieques is starkest at the island's hospital. Hospital Susana Centeno was damaged by the storm and is now closed due to a dangerous amount of mold, Felix says.

Now, it's operating in tan military-style tents in the parking lot. ""I consider this camping,"" says Dr. Jose Carrasquillo, the physician at the facility. This clinic doesn't even have a port-a-potty – the restroom is a shallow bowl suspended on spindly metal legs with a lid, positioned outside one of the tent flaps.

Now, Carrasquillo, who has an easy laugh even in tough circumstances, says his medical work depends on improvising. He has to makes do with what he has. To demonstrate how he operates in the dimly lit tents, he pulls out a small flashlight and holds it between his teeth. 

""This is how I suture,"" he says. ""Because the patient needs it.""

The doctor operates without equipment that would be standard in most hospitals. And transporting patients with more serious injuries to a proper facility isn't always possible. 

""If the weather is bad, no one gets out of here,"" he says. ""That means I'm going to have to treat anything that comes here. That's a challenge.""  For example, he says he recently treated a man burned by a generator that exploded, and a young girl impaled by a screwdriver.

Local authorities are going through a lengthy approval process to turn a school into a hospital.  

The improvised facility ""scares me, it's not going to last long,"" Carrasquillo adds. ""And the hurricane season is going to come in six months, again.""

Solar hopes

In the facility's parking lot is a field of solar panels, a technology seen as a source of hope to residents held prisoner by the dysfunctional electricity system currently in place.

Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, recently announced a series of solar electricity projects using Tesla energy storage, including one at this hospital. On Vieques, the sanitary sewer treatment plant, the water pumping station, a home for elderly people and the Boys and Girls Club of Vieques will also have these systems, according to the announcement. 

""We understand the need to provide energy options to improve resiliency when there is a grid outage,"" Rossello said in a press release about Vieques and its neighboring island Culebra.

The projects are raising hopes of a future for Vieques that does not rely on Puerto Rico's main grid at all. Mark Martin-Bras, director of community relations and research for The Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust, says the island's future should absolutely be solar power and alternative energy.

It could even be used as a model for how to switch to solar, he says.

""Vieques is a good example and small enough to be a model for [companies] like Tesla who proposed this type of work and other components of alternative energy, that can make this island a model for the world,"" Martin-Bras says. 

Felix, the mayor's spokesperson, says the idea of fully powering Vieques with alternative energy is appealing. It would benefit everyone, removing the need for months-long repair processes like this one. But the truth is, he says, the isolated island just simply doesn't have the money.

"After victories in Virginia and New Jersey Tuesday, the Democrats have received a new dose of optimism about the 2018 midterm elections. But how warranted is that optimism? NPR's Michel Martin talks with Politico's Susan Glasser.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: 

Let's talk about the Democrats now. They won big governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia and tight mayoral races in Charlotte, N.C., and St. Petersburg, Fla. And all this comes after reports of real dissension within the party about its direction and many observers questioning whether Democrats can figure out how to remain competitive in the era of Trump.

And one of those observers casting a critical eye was Susan Glasser, Politico's chief international affairs correspondent. She had only recently written in The New Yorker about turmoil in the Democratic Party, so we thought we'd invite her back onto the program to see what she has to say this week. Susan Glasser, thanks so much for speaking with us once again.

SUSAN GLASSER: Thank you.

MARTIN: So when you were last on the program, it looked as though the Republican, Ed Gillespie's embrace of some of the Trump approach could help him beat Democrat Ralph Northam in Virginia's governor's race. And then former DNC head Donna Brazile had just released excerpts from her book suggesting that Hillary Clinton rigged 2016's Democratic primaries. And then now, you know, a near - a near-clean sweep of races from New York to Florida. So, you know, how did this happen? And does any of this kind of change your earlier analysis?

GLASSER: I just read something that kind of sums it up. A year after the Trump upset, the laws of political gravity still apply. The bottom line is that both Virginia and New Jersey actually went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. So on some level, it's actually not a shocker that they would vote for Democrats for governor in 2017. But there were a lot of very nervous Democrats, in particular about the Virginia gubernatorial race. One of the things we're learning is that turnout is very unpredictable in this new era, and there was a big turnout. So that's one factor.

But I don't think people should be under any illusions that it means that there's no debate inside the Democratic Party. The same debate that existed a week ago still exists now, and it's primarily a strategic debate and a debate about, you know, how far left should the party go? Does it speak to identity politics or the economy, the economy, the economy, as Stan Greenberg summed up in that New Yorker piece of mind that you mentioned? And I think that debate is going to be with us for a long time.

MARTIN: Well, it's interesting because in a - it's just - sticking with the Virginia race for a minute, I mean, Donald Trump made the argument that Ed Gillespie lost because he didn't fully embrace Donald Trump. You know, others are saying that the - Ed Gillespie couldn't win because the Trumpism without Trump doesn't work, that you really need the combination of his, you know, hard-edged policies with his hard-edged personality in order to make that work. What do you think about that?

GLASSER: Look, I think that most observers I've spoken with - Democrats and Republicans, by the way, aside from the most hardcore Trump supporters, but even many smart Republicans - think that Donald Trump was the liability that sank Ed Gillespie in Virginia. He actually outperformed in some areas of the state. Arguably, he campaigned in a strong way, but Trump is a huge liability in particular among these suburban voters. His approval ratings as you know are at a historic low.

And, you know, the bottom line is we often spend a lot of time talking about the angry white working-class voters who are Trump's base. But there are a lot more middle-class suburban voters than there are voters like that across America. And that, I think, is why Republicans are very nervous looking at the 2018 midterm elections and beyond.

MARTIN: That's Susan Glasser. She's a contributing writer for The New Yorker and Politico's chief international affairs correspondent. Susan, thanks so much for speaking with us.

GLASSER: Thank you.

"All 58 of the people killed in the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 died of gunshot wounds, the Clark County County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner has determined.

Nearly all of the fatalities were caused by a single gunshot wound, though six victims died from multiple wounds. Most had been shot in the head, chest or back. The deaths were all ruled homicides.

In the chaos of the shooting, in which bullets rained down on a country music festival from a gunman on the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel, it wasn't immediately clear whether any victims might have died from trampling as the crowds sought to escape the fusillade.

The shooter, Stephen Paddock, died from a gunshot wound to the head that entered through the mouth. His cause of death was a suicide, the coroner's office said.

Coroner John Fudenberg told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that it has taken more than two months to release the information because his office wanted to be accurate and notify the victims' families first.

""Because of the impact that this incident had on our community, and the attention that this incident received, it became very important for us to ensure that all of the families had the information prior to us releasing it to the public,""  Fudenberg told the newspaper. 

More than 500 people were injured during the shooting, and thousands of others who were there at the Route 91 Harvest Festival have been trying to cope in the months since the tragedy.

One woman who was there, Melissa Barham, recently told NPR's Weekend Edition that since the massacre, she's been and sad depressed and wonders whether anything has really changed since the Sandy Hook shooting five years ago.

""I wake up every morning and I journal,"" Barham said. ""I pick one of the victims and I write down their name and their age and where they're from and then just details about them. And I just think about them.""

""And this time of year, the holidays, make it really hard.""

"There's no question about it: Breast-feeding is hard. And we aren't born knowing to do it.

As we reported a few weeks ago, women all around the world have problems when they first start breast-feeding. From midtown Manhattan to northern Namibia, they need help to learn how to do it.

We invited our readers and listeners to tell us how their culture helps moms become breast-feeding pros. The stories we received are so wonderful, we couldn't wait to share them. We even heard from a few dads!

Turns out, many cultures have come up with ways to ensure that new moms feel supported, loved and able to overcome any problems they have while learning to breast-feed. In many places, moms aren't left on their own as they often are in the States. Instead, a whole village grows up around them and their new baby.

Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

I just finished a year of breast-feeding. In my culture, mothers and sisters are a huge help after you bring a newborn home. Your mother makes you a huge pot of a Filipino chicken soup filled with maringa leaves and green papaya. This soup is supposed to help increase your milk supply, but just having your mother's home cooking is an extreme comfort when recovering from childbirth — and trying to figure out breast-feeding.

Rearing a child really does take a village!

-Gemma Markham, who now lives in California

A pregnant woman usually goes to her mom's house during the seventh month of pregnancy, so she can relax mentally and physically. Her husband visits during weekends.

After giving birth, the new mom stays with her own mom for about six months. This period is crucial for the health of the new mom and her baby. Even working moms have this privilege because they receive six months of paid maternity leave.

I am on maternity leave now, and I don't have to worry about anything because of my mom's help. She wakes me up to feed the baby and changes my diet if my milk supply drops. She teaches me how to breast-feed and helps with the baby — bathes him, changes nappies. The only thing I do is feed the baby.

-Thejeswini Mahalakshimi, from the state of Tamilnadu

Our two middle children were born in Denmark. And the support there was simply wonderful on so many levels.

In the hospital, the new mothers share rooms for socializing, support and trouble shooting — especially breast-feeding problems. Moms eat in a communal setting at a family table with bassinets by their side. Or they breast-feed during the meals.

Conversations are lively and invaluable. I felt empowered! I left the hospital with new friends and feeling ready to ""do this thing""!

Now compare that experience to the one I had in the U.S., where I birthed my first child. I was discharged from the hospital 24 hours after delivery with nothing but a diaper bag of freebies and my support network of family overseas. I felt alone, unsure and pressured to succeed.

Women need each other for guidance and to come alongside each other during this blessed, yet hard, job of motherhood. We need to stop isolating our new moms in private labor suites if at all possible but instead eat together, talk it out, cry it out and ""do life"" together.

Breast-feeding is nature and nurture. We owe it to each other to share what we know!

-Natascha Georgeff, who now lives in Des Moines, Iowa

Traditionally, the grandma stays with the new mom for one to three months in Nepal. The new mom is not allowed to do any kind of household work chores during this time.

-Yogesh Adhikari, who now lives in Rochester, New York

My wife delivered our first child — a baby boy — three months ago. Help with breast-feeding began right away in the hospital. Most of the nurses and midwives around the hospital are mothers with vast experience. They are the ones to guide the inexperienced mother on how to properly breast-feed her new baby.

The learning process is mostly informal. Nurses offer advice when they see a mom struggling. In most hospitals, the nurses bathe the baby every morning and evening and show the moms how to do it.

Women are often discharged from the hospital within three days of delivery [like in the U.S.]. Then the second phase of learning starts at home.

Among the Igbos of Nigeria, which is my tribe, it's custom for the young mothers to have their own moms come and spend at least three months with them. During this period, the learning process continues. The grandma also prepares special delicacies that will help the young mother to produce more milk.

In Africa, communal living is encouraged. This means a new mother will receive a lot of visitors, including friends, relatives and even just acquaintances. All these visitors come with their own experiences and aren't shy to share them.

-Chijioke Okoli

We have what's called kraamzorg, which roughly translates to postpartum medical care. A trained health-care worker comes to a new mother's home for the week following the birth. She gives mom and baby medical check-ups, assists with household chores, helps with breast-feeding and alerts the midwife to any problems. The midwife also visits several times during this period and helps with breast-feeding concerns. Health insurers cover all these visits, which are considered basic postnatal care.

My own personal experience as a new mother in the Netherlands was incredibly positive, particularly with regard to breast-feeding. I am now studying to be a midwife, and I have seen firsthand how vital kraamzorg is to a good start for newborns and new mothers.

-Diana Raesner

Traditionally, the new mother does not leave the house for 40 days. Usually the mother-in-law and other women on both sides of the family come and help out.

The new mom does not do any housework for 40 days. She focuses only on recovering and on feeding her baby. The other women help tremendously with latching the baby and keeping the mom's milk supply high. They prepare nutritious food for the mom so she can produce high-quality milk.

As a new mom, you are never in doubt about what to do because the older women will always have the answers. The mom breast-feeds on demand since that's her only job in the first few month of baby's life.

-Ingrid Bego

I'm ethnically Chinese, but I live in California and just gave birth to my daughter, Clara [pictured, above]. My parents have been absolutely essential in my recovery and mental health. They still come by multiple times a week to make sure I'm fed and rested — and to play with their beloved granddaughter.

In addition, I joined a breast-feeding support group on Facebook shortly before I gave birth. I didn't think I needed it, but someone added me and I was just there. Boy, did I need it!

The first time I posted a cry for help on the group, I was literally sobbing because my baby was two days old, and my milk hadn't come in yet. Our pediatrician wanted me to supplement with formula. My mom wanted me to supplement. My husband did, too. But the moms on the Facebook group gave me reassurance, encouragement and helped me find the strength and composure to be patient while my milk came in.

This Facebook group is a loving village of mothers who support each other. We celebrate each other's successes, and we share the burden of our sorrows.

The challenges of breast-feeding are constantly changing. My mom, although helpful, is almost 30 years removed from the experience. So when it comes to questions in the middle of the night, I seek out this village of moms online, and they're always there, even at 2 a.m. Because somebody is always awake.

-Wendy Sunderland and her new daughter, Clara

"In a letter released Friday, President Trump's lawyers said a decade's worth of his tax returns show that he doesn't owe money to Russian lenders and that he has received no income from Russian sources, ""with a few exceptions.""

The exceptions include this: ""In 2008, Trump Properties LLC sold an estate in Florida, that it had acquired in 2005 for approximately $41 million, to a Russian billionaire for $95 million.""

That buyer was Dmitry Rybolovlev, who never moved into the 62,000-square-foot mansion before tearing it down.

Another exception was the $12.2 million made from holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013, according to the letter signed by attorneys Sheri A. Dillon and William F. Nelson.

The lawyers also noted that Trump very likely has received undisclosed payments from Russians for hotel rooms, rounds of golf and Trump-licensed products, such as wine, ties and mattresses.

The March 8 letter was addressed to Trump, who passed it along to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Trump mentioned it during his Thursday NBC News interview with Lester Holt, saying he had ""nothing to do with Russia. I have no investments in Russia. None whatsoever.""

Without copies of Trump's tax returns, the claims by his lawyers cannot be verified. The lawyers did not define ""Russians."" Many companies based in Russia use subsidiaries in other places, such as Cyprus or the British Virgin Islands, to conduct transactions overseas.

In an interview with The Economist this week, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns. Asked whether he would release them, he replied: ""I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they're not going to ... nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually.""

In recent days, the Trump administration has been caught up in an intensifying swirl of questions about potential financial ties involving Russians, Trump and his associates.

The lawyers who wrote the letter about his finances are with the firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius, which was named ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" for 2016 by Chambers & Partners, which ranks lawyers.

"Updated at 4:03 p.m. ET

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters Friday that President Trump raised the issue of Russian election interference in a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump opened the more than two-hour meeting ""by raising the concerns of the American people"" about Russia's meddling in last year's presidential race, according to Tillerson. Trump and Putin had a ""robust and lengthy exchange on the subject,"" the secretary of state said.

As he has done in the past, Putin denied involvement in any meddling in the election.

Trump and Putin agreed, however, that the issue of election interference was a substantial hindrance in their ability to move the U.S.-Russia relationship forward. The two world leaders also agreed to work on further commitments of noninterference in the affairs of the United States and in the democratic process in the U.S. as well as in other countries.

There is ""more work to be done in that regard,"" Tillerson said.

The top U.S. diplomat spoke Friday at a press briefing after Trump held his first official meeting with Putin. Trump and Putin exchanged a warm handshake in a brief interlude with reporters and photographers before their meeting began.

""President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well. We've had some very, very good talks,"" Trump told reporters before the meeting. ""We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue, but we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening — for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you.""

The two men were scheduled for a 30-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, but ended up talking almost five times that long.

Pres. Trump says he's had 'very very good talks' with Putin, looks forward to 'positive things' for Russia and U.S. https://t.co/XgPkxJpnjP

Beforehand, Putin mentioned that they have talked already a few times over the phone.

""But phone conversation is never enough,"" he said through a translator. ""If we want to have positive results in bilaterals and be able to resolve most acute international topics and issues, definitely we need personal meetings.

""And I'm delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President, and I hope, as you have said, our meeting will yield positive results for Russia and the U.S.""

The two presidents were joined in the meeting by their translators and by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Tillerson.

Speaking from Hamburg on Russian state TV, Lavrov said Trump ""heard President Putin's clear statements that it's not true the Russian leadership intervened in the election, and that he accepts those statements.""

Tillerson told reporters that his interpretation of the exchange was that the two men agreed on the need to move past the issue of election interference. The secretary of state said the focus is now on how the U.S. secures a commitment that Russia has no intention of interfering in U.S. elections in the future — and how the Trump administration creates a framework to judge whether Russia is keeping that commitment.

Last month, Putin told international journalists in St. Petersburg that it's possible that ""patriotic"" Russian hackers outside of his government might be trying to engage in cyberattacks against the world's democracies. ""I must stress, on a state level, we are never engaged into these kind of activity,"" said Putin at the time, according to a media report.

The U.S. intelligence community has unanimously concluded, however, that Russian intelligence services did interfere with ""active measures"" including cyberattacks, social media bots and other techniques — and that they did so at Putin's direction.

The majority of the meeting, Tillerson said, was spent parsing out details of a cease-fire in southwest Syria that between the U.S. and Russia. Jordan and Israel are also part of the deal. A state-run news agency in Jordan reported that the cease-fire would go into effect on Sunday.

Putin and Trump also discussed the increasing threat posed by North Korea. Earlier this week, that country tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, which showed the theoretical potential to reach Alaska.

""I would say the Russians see (North Korea) a little differently than we do,"" Tillerson said. ""We're going to continue those discussions and ask them to do more. Russia does have economic activity with North Korea. But, I would also hasten to add, Russia's official policy is the same as ours: a denuclearized Korean peninsula.""

Friday's warm meeting between the two leaders also came just a day after Trump spoke in Poland, a country known for its distaste for Russia, and reiterated America's commitment to Article 5 of the NATO charter.

""The United States has demonstrated not merely with words, but with its actions, that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment,"" he said.

The statement would not have been newsworthy if not for Trump's decision in May to omit a line in a speech that reaffirmed the U.S. commitment. That decision raised eyebrows especially in Eastern Europe, as Putin has shown in Ukraine and Crimea that he is intent on projecting Russia's power and influence in Europe beyond his country's borders.

While Friday's meeting was the first time the two men have met since Trump became president, it's unclear whether they've met in person before.

In an interview in 2013 with David Letterman, the Late Show host asked Trump whether he had met Putin before.

""I met him once,"" Trump said.

But in 2016, Trump seemingly began to backtrack on that claim. In July, he told a CBS affiliate in Miami, ""I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever.""

He reiterated that at a news conference that month, too.

""I never met Putin,"" he said. ""I don't know who Putin is.""

CNN put together a list of 80 times Trump talked about the Russian president over the past four years, which gives insight into how his rhetoric has and hasn't changed.

Compared with predecessor President Barack Obama, however, Trump has been noticeably warmer toward Russia. Whereas Obama once mentioned the threats posed by Ebola and ""Russian aggression"" in the same sentence back in 2014, Trump has repeatedly talked about wanting to improve relations with Russia.

On Friday, the two presidents hit it off immediately, Tillerson said.

""There was a clear positive chemistry between the two,"" he added. ""There was such a level of engagement and exchange, neither one of them wanted to stop.""

He said that at one point the first lady was even sent into the meeting to try to persuade them to finish up, but ""that didn't work either."" They continued talking for another hour.

That is good news for many Americans. According to a recent NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll, 46 percent of adults view Trump's goal of improving relations as a mostly good thing, whereas 41 percent view it as a mostly bad thing.

"More than three dozen journalists have been killed in Mexico over two and a half decades. The editor of Norte announced the closure in a goodbye editorial published in its last edition.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: 

The headline in a Mexican border town's newspaper yesterday contained just one word - adios. In a chilling letter to readers, the longtime publisher of Norte newspaper said he could no longer work and protect his journalists in a climate of fear and insecurity. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, three journalists have been killed in the past month, including one of Norte's senior correspondents.

CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: For the past 27 years, Oscar Cantu has put out a daily paper in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Yesterday was his last.

OSCAR CANTU: I'm protesting because of the impunity that we've lived with journalists that have been killed and the criminals have not been brought to justice.

KAHN: Cantu says it's just too risky for his staff. Last month, his state capital correspondent, Miroslava Breach, was gunned down by two assailants. She was backing out of her garage, taking one of her sons to school, when she was shot eight times.

CANTU: The way - it was so violent. She was a very professional journalist, very brave, very valiant, uncorruptible.

KAHN: Cantu says he's filled with grief and can't allow anyone else to suffer like Breach did or as her family is now. In his open letter to readers, Cantu wrote that it has become clear through the deaths of so many journalists he can no longer promote a free press that informs with objectivity, honesty and transparency.

March was a particularly deadly month for reporters in Mexico. Along with Breach, two others were killed, one shot dead leaving a restaurant with his family in Veracruz, another shot in front of a car wash in Guerrero. All of these states are seeing an increase in drug trafficking-related violence. Carlos Lauria is with the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

CARLOS LAURIA: This is widespread. This is not in one single place. Across Mexico, there are many media outlets that cannot fulfill its job.

KAHN: According to his organization, 38 journalists have been killed because of their work since 1992, another 50 murdered under suspicious circumstances. Lauria says the situation in Mexico is dire, a full-blown crisis that needs to be a top priority for the government.

LAURIA: The climate of fear and intimidation where journalists and media are working is creating widespread censorship. And this is clearly putting the stability of the Mexican democracy at risk.

KAHN: In 2006, the Mexican government set up a special prosecutor to investigate crimes against the press. Lauria says that office has only resolved three cases since then. The prosecutor's office had no immediate comment. Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Mexico City.

"Updated at 5:51 p.m. ET

President Trump is responding to the backlash against the allegations that he shared ""highly classified"" information with the Russians by saying he had ""the absolute right to do"" so.

He tweeted Tuesday morning:

As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining....

...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.

And he went a step further, again taking aim at fired former FBI Director James Comey and ""leakers"":

I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....

The irony seemed to be lost on Trump that he himself is being accused of being a ""leaker"" — and that he criticized Hillary Clinton's ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information during the campaign, calling her ""not fit"":

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."" Not fit!

The Washington Post broke the news Monday night, and others confirmed and added to the reporting, that Trump revealed to Russian officials in a meeting in the Oval Office details of an ISIS plot to use laptops on airplanes. The information was classified and reportedly came from an ally in the Middle East.

The New York Times, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal reported later Tuesday that the classified intelligence in question was provided by Israel — an important U.S. ally and one of the countries Trump will travel to later this week on his first foreign trip as president. Passing along the intelligence from Israel, The Times noted, raises the possibility that the Russians could give it to Iran, their close ally but Israel's main antagonist.

NPR has not confirmed the details of the reports.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer wouldn't comment Tuesday on whether or not Israel was the source of the intelligence.

Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., said in a statement, reported by The New York Times, that ""Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump.""

Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Monday night that the story in The Post, ""as reported, is false."" But he also noted that the president talked about ""common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known.""

McMaster took to the lectern in the White House Briefing Room on Tuesday and told reporters that he stood by his statement. ""The premise of that article is false,"" McMaster said, though he did not say the entirety of the article is false and would not confirm nor deny that Trump revealed classified information to the Russians.

""What the president shared was wholly appropriate,"" McMaster said. He added that there was ""no lapse in national security.""

Instead, he focused on leaks. ""I think national security is put at risk by this leak and leaks like this,"" he said.

McMaster also did not say whether the president decided in the moment to share the information, but the adviser revealed a key detail that is going to raise more questions.

""The president wasn't even aware where this information came from,"" McMaster said. ""He wasn't briefed.""

Reporters were not able to follow up because McMaster then walked off.

But where the information came from is a key piece of information, given that it could put operatives from a key ally at risk.

None of that explains why the White House was reaching out to the CIA and National Security Agency to let them know what the president had revealed. McMaster said that was done merely out of an ""overabundance of caution.""

Michael Anton, spokesman for the National Security Council, tells NPR's Tamara Keith, ""My conscience is clear saying there is no contradiction between McMaster's statement and the president's tweet.""

Becca Glover Watkins, a spokeswoman for Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., tells NPR's Geoff Bennett that the committee ""has reached out to the White House to request additional information on recent reports about alleged dissemination of intelligence information.""

By almost 5 p.m., Burr told reporters he still hadn't heard back from the White House. It's been ""a very busy day,"" Burr said, ""but we hope to talk with them before we leave.""

""I'd prefer to have a conversation with an individual who was in the room about what actually was said, and then we can legitimately comment on whether we have concerns about what was said,"" Burr also told reporters Tuesday evening.

And an aide to a member of the House Intelligence Committee confirmed to NPR's Susan Davis that CIA Director Mike Pompeo will brief the committee Tuesday evening. Pompeo's appearance was previously scheduled, but obviously all subjects are on the table, the aide said.

To be totally clear: If Trump revealed classified information, it is not illegal. The president can declassify anything he wants — just by saying it. There's no formal process he needs to go through. But this kind of information was so ""highly classified"" that disclosing it could subject any other person to jail time.

Lawfare blog weighed in on that on Monday:

""The reason is that the very purpose of the classification system is to protect information the President, usually through his subordinates, thinks sensitive. So the President determines the system of designating classified information through Executive Order, and he is entitled to depart from it at will. Currently, Executive Order 13526 governs national security information.

""The Supreme Court has stated in Department of the Navy v. Egan that '[the President's] authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this Constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.' Because of his broad constitutional authority in this realm, the president can, at any time, either declassify information or decide whom to share it with.""

Lawfare got into more of the potential problems, like the possibility of this disclosure violating the president's oath of office and of it raising the stakes over whether Trump records conversations in the Oval Office and for his FBI director pick.

Still, the issue of criminality is not the whole of the discussion. NPR's Mara Liasson said on NPR podcast Up First that what Trump is accused of doing is ""lawful but awful.""

But there are also potential national security consequences. There is the potential that:

1) The Middle East ally that gave this information to the U.S. will be less likely to share in the future,

2) Other even-closer U.S. allies may be less likely to share intelligence, and

3) If the first two happen, Americans would be put at risk, as the U.S. tries to prevent terrorist attacks and threats like the one Trump allegedly told the Russians about.

Trump also continues to have problems with the intelligence community. It's never a good thing for a president to be at odds with some of the very people who are tasked with keeping the country safe. If the focus of either or both is getting back at the other, who's watching the gate?

Of course, the U.S. has had problematic intelligence situations with the rest of the world in the past. Some in China are upset that the NSA, for example, was reportedly behind the origination of the virus that was used in the recent ransomware attack before losing control of it.

The NSA was also at the heart of the Edward Snowden drama, which revealed that the U.S. spied on world leaders, including close allies.

And, of course, there was the intelligence failures over the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the rationale that led to the 2003 invasion of the country.

U.S. alliances survived those and more, but they all occurred under presidents who were far more careful with their language, not to mention their tweets.

Stung by new American sanctions, Russia's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. must downsize its diplomatic and technical staff in Moscow and other cities. The ministry is also suspending the U.S. Embassy's use of two sites — a storage facility and a dacha on an island in the Moscow River.

President Trump said Friday night he would sign the sanctions legislation because Congress was responsive to his input on the bill.

The ministry says the U.S. has until Sept. 1 to cut the number of its staff at the Moscow embassy and at three consulates to match the exact number of Russian diplomats who are working in the U.S. — 455 people, according to the ministry's announcement.

After Aug. 1, U.S. staff will also be barred from using a recreational property on the bucolic island of Serebryany Bor, along with being barred from using warehouses on Moscow's Dorozhnaya Street.

More retaliation could come: The ministry added that it will mirror any further cuts to its staff in America.

The move comes the day after the U.S. Congress gave bilateral approval to a new slate of sanctions on Russia over its interference in the 2016 election. Those sanctions also include punishments for Iran and North Korea. The legislation specifies that President Trump can't ease the sanctions without congressional approval.

The White House says Trump supports sanctions on the three countries in question and will review the legislation.

The Foreign Ministry's action comes one day after the prospect of new punishments clearly rankled the Kremlin.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking ahead of the Senate vote, accused U.S. lawmakers of 'insolence' and promised retaliation if the sanctions become law,"" as NPR's Scott Neuman reported Thursday.

At the end of 2016, President Obama cited U.S. findings that Russia had meddled with the recent presidential election when he expelled members of Russia's diplomatic corps and issued sanctions on Russia's mining and oil industry.

Obama also ordered Russia's Foreign Ministry to leave two compounds it owns in Maryland and New York.

"Efforts to boost public confidence in U.S. elections are proceeding on two parallel tracks right now. One is moving slowly, but steadily. The other is hardly moving at all.

Most of the attention has gone to a commission set up by President Trump to look into allegations of voter fraud and other electoral problems. The panel — called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity — has been mired in controversy ever since it was formed earlier this year. Its work now appears stalled amid internal divisions and outside legal challenges.

But as that panel limps along, several other efforts to address threats to U.S voting are making progress.

This month, the federal government and state and local election officials met in Atlanta to start the process of sharing more information about potential threats and pooling security resources.

The move was in response to intelligence findings that Russia probed or tried to hack into numerous state election systems last year, and that it also waged a widespread disinformation campaign online.

""They did it first of all to mess with our heads,"" former CIA and NSA director, Gen. Michael Hayden, told a committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine last week. He called the Russian effort to sow discord during last year's U.S. election ""really quite an impressive, impressive operation.""

Hayden attributed the meddling campaign to Russian President Vladimir Putin's desire to elevate his nation's standing by discrediting Western democratic institutions. ""He wants to bring us down in the eyes of ourselves and of his people,"" he said.

Sharing information

In response to the threat, the federal government earlier this year declared elections to be part of the nation's ""critical infrastructure.""

Bob Kolasky, an official with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who helped organize the meeting with state and local officials, said one of the most important things they did was to address how to share information when intelligence officials see a potential threat.

""We've asked all 50 states, their senior election officials, to map out how they would like us to communicate if we have a particular piece of information relevant to their election, "" he said, adding that there's clearly no ""one way"" to do it.

Many state officials were upset that they only learned last month which of the 21 states' election systems were targeted by Russian hackers in 2016. Election officials say they need that information right away so they can take steps to avoid potential attacks.

Kolasky said they plan to set up a similar coordinating council by the end of the year to share information with representatives of companies that manufacture and sell election equipment. At least one vendor, which provides voter registration systems in several states, was targeted last year as part of a Russian e-mail phishing attack. Many cyber security experts think hackers could use vendors as an entree into state and local voting systems.

Kolasky made his remarks to the National Academies committee, which is looking at vulnerabilities in voting technology and expects to issue a report next year with recommendations on how to tighten security.

Multiple efforts

It's one of several such efforts. Harvard University's Belfer Center has also launched a project called '""Defending Digital Democracy."" It held a tabletop exercise last month with election officials that simulated an Election Day attack. The group plans to issue a ""playbook"" to help election administrators and others respond to such threats. A coalition that includes the Center for Internet Security and the Atlantic Council is working on a similar handbook of election cybersecurity ""best practices.""

Also last month, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, announced an overhaul of voluntary guidelines to be used by states when purchasing new voting equipment. The goal is to improve security and reliability of the equipment.

All these efforts are aimed at fighting a threat that intelligence officials warn is very much alive. They say Russia and other parties, possibly North Korea or criminal interests, were likely emboldened by the disruptions caused in last year's elections. Although there's no evidence any votes were changed, Russian hackers were able to break into Illinois' voter registration system and gain access to an Arizona election worker's computer password and ID credentials.

Among the biggest concerns going forward is that hackers will try to tamper with future elections by either changing votes or, more likely, sowing chaos by hacking into voter registration lists or election night reporting systems. If nothing else, last year's activities have unsettled the election community and raise public doubts about the integrity of the election process.

Election hacking 'not a high priority' for White House

Hayden said he was worried that the full story of what happened last year won't be known ""because within the executive branch at the political level getting to this narrative is not a high priority.""

He noted that as recently as a few weeks ago, Trump referred to Russian interference in the elections as a ""hoax."" ""He thinks it's about him,"" said Hayden, adding that it's really ""about us.""

Trump has been dismissive of intelligence findings that Russia probed or tried to hack into election systems last year. The President has said that Democrats want to blame their electoral losses on Russia instead of admitting they had a bad candidate.

He's focused much more attention on the possibility that some people voted fraudulently. The President appointed his commission after claiming, without providing any evidence, that between three and five million people cast illegal votes last year.

""If we want to make America great again, we have to protect the integrity of the vote and our voters,"" he said at the commission's first meeting in July.

The panel has requested detailed voter information from all states with the intention of determining whether people are registered or voted illegally. Most states have only provided partial information because of privacy concerns.

Few election officials believe that the president's claims of widespread fraud have any credibility. Some have questioned whether the commission's real goal is to impose tighter restrictions on voters such as proof-of-citizenship requirements.

The 12-member panel held its last meeting in September. Some Democratic members have complained that they've been kept in the dark ever since about what the commission is up to and when it will meet again.

"The Fox News Channel and a wealthy supporter of President Trump worked in concert under the watchful eye of the White House to concoct a story about the death of a young Democratic National Committee aide, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.

The explosive claim is part of a lawsuit filed against Fox News by Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for the news network. The suit was obtained exclusively by NPR.

Wheeler alleges Fox News and the Trump supporter intended to deflect public attention from growing concern about the administration's ties to the Russian government. His suit charges that a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him to propel her story.

Fox's president of news, Jay Wallace, told NPR on Monday that there was no ""concrete evidence"" that Wheeler was misquoted by the reporter, Malia Zimmerman. The news executive did not address a question about the story's allegedly partisan origins. Fox News declined to allow Zimmerman to comment for this story.

The story, which first aired in May, was retracted by Fox News a week later. Fox News has, to date, taken no action in response to what it said was a failure to adhere to the network's standards.

The lawsuit focuses particular attention on the role of the Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, in weaving the story. He is a wealthy Dallas investor and unpaid Fox commentator on financial matters who has emerged as a reliable Republican surrogate in recent years. Butowsky offered to pay for Wheeler to investigate the death of the DNC aide, Seth Rich, on behalf of his grieving parents in Omaha, Neb.

On April 20, a month before the story ran, Butowsky and Wheeler — the investor and the investigator — met at the White House with then-press secretary Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering.

The first page of the lawsuit quotes a voicemail and text from Butowsky boasting that Trump himself had reviewed drafts of the Fox News story just before it went to air and was published.

Spicer now tells NPR that he took the meeting as a favor to Butowsky. Spicer says he was unaware of any contact involving the president. And Butowsky tells NPR that he was kidding about Trump's involvement.

""Rod Wheeler unfortunately was used as a pawn by Ed Butowsky, Fox News and the Trump administration to try and steer away the attention that was being given about the Russian hacking of the DNC emails,"" says Douglas Wigdor, Wheeler's lawyer.

The back story

On May 16, the Fox News Channel broke what it called a ""bombshell"" story about an unsolved homicide: the July 2016 shooting of 27-year-old Democratic Party staffer Seth Rich.

Unfounded conspiracy theories involving Rich abounded in the months after his death, in part because WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cryptically suggested that Rich's death may have been related to the leaks of tens of thousands of emails from Democratic Party officials and their allies at the peak of the presidential campaign.

Fox News' story, which took flight online and ran in segments across major shows, breathed fresh life into the rumors. Fox reported that the leaks came from inside the party and not from hackers linked to Russia — despite the conclusions of the nation's most senior intelligence officials. The network suggested that Democrats might have been connected to Rich's death and that a cover-up had thwarted the official investigation.

The network cited an unnamed FBI official. And the report relied heavily on Wheeler, a former police detective, hired months earlier on behalf of the Riches by Butowsky.

These developments took place during growing public concern over a federal investigation into the Trump camp's possible collusion with the Russian government during the campaign. The allegations have since touched the president's son and son-in-law, his former campaign manager, his attorney general and his first national security adviser, who resigned as a result.

The question of Rich's death took on greater urgency for Butowsky after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in early May. Comey had been overseeing the Russia investigation. The story ran just a week later.

Fox's report went sideways shortly after it was posted online and aired on Fox & Friends. It was denounced by the Rich family, D.C. police, Democratic Party officials and even, privately, by some journalists within the network. Within hours, Wheeler told other news outlets that Fox News had put words in his mouth.

Despite those concerns, Wheeler appeared on the shows of Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and Fox News star Sean Hannity, who devoted significant time to the story that night and in subsequent days. In speaking with Wheeler, Hannity said: ""If this is true and Seth Rich gave WikiLeaks the DNC e-mails ... this blows the whole Russia collusion narrative completely out of the water.""

A week later, on May 23, Fox retracted the story, saying the reporting process failed to live up to its standards. Hannity said he would take a break from talking about Rich's death out of respect for the family. And there it has largely stood — until now.

The fake news story

In the lawsuit, the private investigator sets out a different version of events. Wheeler, a paid Fox News contributor since 2005, alleges the story was orchestrated behind the scenes and from the outset by Butowsky, who hired him on behalf of the Rich family.

The following account reflects the verbatim quotes provided from the texts, emails, voicemails and recorded conversations cited in Wheeler's lawsuit, except as otherwise noted.

According to the lawsuit, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer meets at the White House with Wheeler and Butowsky to review the Rich story a month before Fox News ran the piece.

On May 14, about 36 hours before Fox News' story appears, Butowsky leaves a voicemail for Wheeler, saying, ""We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do.""

Butowsky also texts Wheeler: ""Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you.""

Spicer confirms meeting with the two but denies claims about the president.

""Ed's been a longtime supporter of the president and asked to meet to catch up,"" Spicer tells NPR on Monday night.

""I didn't know who Rod Wheeler was. Once we got into my office, [Butowsky] said, 'I'm sure you recognize Rod Wheeler from Fox News.' ""

Spicer says Butowsky laid out what had been found about the case. ""It had nothing to do with advancing the president's domestic agenda — and there was no agenda,"" Spicer says. ""They were just informing me of the [Fox] story.""

Spicer says he is not aware of any contact, direct or not, between Butowsky and Trump. And Butowsky now tells NPR he has never shared drafts of the story with Trump or his aides — that he was joking with a friend.

Instead, Butowsky repeatedly claims that the meeting was set up to address Wheeler's pleas for help landing a job for the Trump administration. Wheeler's attorney, Wigdor, says there is no evidence to support that claim.

In the suit, Wheeler alleges that Butowsky was using the White House references to pressure him.

Wheeler did play his own role in furthering the story. But he contends that he regretted it the same day it aired. His suit alleges Fox News defamed him by manufacturing two false quotations attributed to him and ruining his reputation by blaming him as the deceptive story fell apart. Wheeler, an African-American, is also suing the network for racial discrimination, saying he failed to advance as prominently as white counterparts. Fox News had no comment on that allegation.

Who is Ed Butowsky?

Butowsky is a silver-haired brash investor who became known for helping newly rich athletes figure out how to manage their money — and avoid getting fleeced. A native New Yorker and son of a former top enforcement officer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Butowsky attended the University of Texas in the early 1980s. He set up his own company, Chapwood Capital Investment Management in Addison, Texas, outside Dallas, after a long stint at Morgan Stanley.

Federal records compiled by the election finance database OpenSecrets.org show Butowsky has given money to the campaigns of nine politicians: seven Republicans and two Democrats, including $1,000 to Barack Obama's campaign in January 2008.

In recent years, Butowsky has become outspoken about his political beliefs, becoming a familiar face on Fox News and its sister channel, the Fox Business Network. Butowsky has also appeared on Breitbart News' radio programs featuring then-Breitbart Chairman Steve Bannon, who became Trump's campaign chief and is now the president's senior political strategist.

Butowsky emerged as a vocal backer of Trump's candidacy. He attended Trump's inauguration, posting pictures from the day on social media. In the Seth Rich case, Butowsky presented himself as a good Samaritan who came across a sliver of information about Seth Rich's death and shared it with the Riches.

""I thought, 'You know what? I'm going to help these people out,' "" Butowsky said on the radio show of David Webb, a conservative Fox News contributor. ""Somehow, these people need to know what happened to their little boy."" He gave a similar account in an interview Monday with NPR.

Wheeler's lawsuit alleges that Butowsky's generosity is clearly politically motivated.

On Feb. 23, more than six months after Rich's death, Butowsky introduces himself to Wheeler with a flattering text, citing mutual friends from Fox News. ""Behind the scenes, I do a lot of work, (unpaid) helping to uncover certain stories,"" Butowsky writes, as recounted in the suit.

""[M]y biggest work was revealing most of what we know today about Benghazi,"" the deadly attack in Libya that sparked a congressional investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Later that day, Butowsky speaks to Wheeler for about 20 minutes by phone, saying his primary aim is to help the Rich family. 

The man behind the lawsuit: Rod Wheeler

Wheeler, a 57-year-old former Washington, D.C., homicide detective, was part of the Metropolitan Police Department from 1990 to 1995, when he was dismissed, according to the agency. His New York City-based attorney, Wigdor, says Wheeler was fired for insubordination after his urine tested positive for trace amounts of marijuana.

At the time he meets with Butowsky, Wheeler has been a paid contributor to Fox News for more than 11 years and has been actively but unsuccessfully seeking greater exposure on the network, according to the suit.

Five days later, the two men meet in person at a lunch in Washington. Butowsky introduces an unexpected third guest: Malia Zimmerman, a Fox News investigative reporter based in Los Angeles known for enterprise reporting from a conservative standpoint.

According to the account in the suit, Butowsky cautions Wheeler before they set out to meet the Riches: ""[M]ake sure to play down Fox News. Don't mention you know Malia.""

And Butowsky lays out a different mission than aiding the Rich family. Butowsky says he became convinced that the FBI had a report concluding that Seth Rich's laptop showed he had had contacts with WikiLeaks after speaking to the legendary reporter Seymour Hersh, who was also investigating Rich's death. According to the transcripts in the lawsuit, Butowsky says Hersh had an FBI source who confirmed the report.

In an interview this week, Hersh sounds unconvinced.

""I hear gossip,"" Hersh tells NPR on Monday. ""[Butowsky] took two and two and made 45 out of it.""

Rich's parents initially welcome Wheeler's help and Butowsky's largesse. On March 14, Butowsky pays Wheeler $5,000, through a limited partnership company called Googie LP. (NPR found that Butowsky is listed in Texas public records as its general partner.)

Wheeler does not make great headway. The FBI informs Butowsky, Wheeler and Zimmerman that the agency is not assisting the Washington, D.C., police on the investigation — undercutting claims about an FBI report.

A Metro D.C. police detective tells Wheeler that Rich's death was likely a robbery gone awry and that the FBI is not involved.

Preparing to publish

On May 9, Trump fires Comey.

On May 10, Butowsky and Zimmerman call Wheeler to say they have an FBI source confirming emails were sent from Seth Rich to WikiLeaks, though they do not share the source's identity, according to the investigator's suit. Wheeler will later say this is the only federal law enforcement source that Fox News — or he — has related to this story.

Wheeler says he doesn't know whether that source emerged from Butowsky's conversation with Seymour Hersh or whether it was a fabrication.

The next day, Zimmerman sends Wheeler a draft of her story, which is to run initially on the network's website. It includes no quotes from Wheeler.

The night before the story ran and the day of the story itself, Butowsky coached Wheeler on what to say on the air.""

On the evening of May 14, Butowsky leaves a voicemail for Wheeler raising the stakes by invoking the White House and saying, ""Let's close this deal.""

A bit later that night, at 9:10 p.m., Butowsky texts Wheeler, according to Wheeler's suit: ""Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure.""

As the night before the story is aired progresses, Butowsky is awake, online and anticipating what is to unfold in a few short hours.

Butowsky sends an email to Fox News producers and hosts coaching them on how to frame the Rich story, according to the lawsuit. Recipients included Fox & Friends hosts, Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade.

""I'm actually the one who's been putting this together but as you know, I keep my name out of things because I have no credibility,"" Butowsky writes, as reflected in the Wheeler suit. ""One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion"" between ""Trump and the Russians.""

The night before the story ran and the day of the story itself, Butowsky coaches Wheeler on what to say on the air: ""[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections."" In another text, he writes: ""If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest.""

Fox goes with the story 

The story breaks earlier than expected.

On the evening of May 15, Fox News' sister local station in Washington, Fox 5 DC, runs a story online at once promoting and pre-empting the network's apparent scoop. ""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,"" Wheeler tells the station. ""They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.""

On Fox & Friends, the hosts call the story a 'bombshell.' ""

Asked whether his sources have told him about information linking Rich to the WikiLeaks email dump, Wheeler says, ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

The next morning, the story goes national.

Fox News reports that evidence from Rich's laptop showed he had been in contact with WikiLeaks just days before the site posted those emails. Fox also reports that powerful forces were trying to quash the official investigation into his death.

On Fox & Friends, the hosts call the story a ""bombshell.""

Zimmerman's online story cites an unnamed ""federal investigator who reviewed an FBI report"" for its findings. It also cites Wheeler, incorporating two key quotations from Wheeler that do not appear on video. In each, the private investigator seemingly takes ownership of the accusations.

The first: ""My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.""

The second: ""My investigation shows someone within the D.C. government, Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward. That is unfortunate. Seth Rich's murder is unsolved as a result of that.""

The Riches torch Wheeler, saying they have seen no proof for his contentions.

Wheeler alleges both quotations were fabricated and untrue.

According to the lawsuit, Zimmerman promises to have those lines removed — but they stay in the story. Zimmerman then tells him that her bosses at Fox News had instructed her to leave those quotes in.

That same day, the suit recounts, Zimmerman writes a letter to Seth Rich's father, Joel, distancing Fox News from responsibility for what the network reported: ""Much of our information came from a private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who we understand was working on behalf of you.""

Wheeler challenges Zimmerman over the letter in a three-way phone conversation that also included Butowsky. The Fox News reporter defends herself: ""That's the email that Fox asked me to send him. They wrote it for me.""

Wheeler replies: ""That's not accurate, though, because much, much of the information did not come from me.""

""Not about the emails. Not the part about, I mean, the connection to WikiLeaks,"" Zimmerman acknowledges. ""But the rest of the quotes in the story did.""

Butowsky weighs in: ""One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say."" Later, according to the recordings transcribed in the suit, Butowsky acknowledges Wheeler hadn't made any claims of personal knowledge about emails between Rich and WikiLeaks. ""I know that's not true,"" Butowsky says. ""If I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that.""

Both try to keep Wheeler on board, however.

Zimmerman issues instructions for Wheeler's appearance on Sean Hannity's show later that evening. ""Reread the story we sent you last night [that contained the invented quotes] and stick to the script,"" she texts Wheeler.

Despite his misgivings, Wheeler plays along. On Hannity's show, Wheeler says he doesn't personally know about Rich's emails or computers but says that a ""very credible"" federal investigator says ""he laid eyes on the case file."" Wheeler offers energetic speculation though not much more: ""When you look at that with the totality of everything else that I found in this case it's very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think well perhaps there were some e-mail communications between Seth and WikiLeaks.""

The aftermath

On May 23, Fox News posts an unsigned statement retracting Zimmerman's online story.

The network does not apologize or explain what went wrong. ""The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,"" the statement reads. ""Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.""

In early June, Wheeler meets with Dianne Brandi, general counsel for the network, and Jay Wallace, the network's president for news. He makes his case that fabricated quotes had knowingly been attributed to him. Neither ever publicly speak of the matter afterward, until now. ""Since meeting with Rod Wheeler, we have also met with Malia Zimmerman to try to determine whether Rod was misquoted,"" Wallace says in a statement to NPR. ""As of now, we don't have concrete evidence that he was.""

A Fox News executive knowledgeable about the controversy, who would only speak if granted anonymity, tells NPR, ""The story was published to the website without review by or permission from senior management."" The executive notes that Wallace had placed the broadcast and digital newsgathering teams under the same leadership for the first time after a series of management changes following the forced departure of the network's founder, the late Roger Ailes, and many of his top deputies.

In late June, Wheeler warns Fox News and Butowsky that he may file suit. Three days later, Butowsky tweets: ""Fox News story was pulled b/c Rod Wheeler said [he] didn't say a quote ... How much did DNC pay him?"" And then Butowsky tweets: ""This shows Rod Wheeler has a major battle with the truth.""

The two men, thrust together on a common effort for months, have been torn apart by its aftermath. In the interview with NPR, Butowsky insists that he was acting out of a civic-minded spirit for the Riches and not with any partisan or political drive. Zimmerman remains on staff at Fox News, actively reporting on unrelated stories.

A spokeswoman for the FBI tells NPR this week that the agency has played no part in the investigation of the unsolved homicide. And a spokeswoman for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department says, ""MPD stands behind its original assertion that Seth Rich was the victim of a botched armed robbery.""

Ebenezer Scrooge was famously visited by three ghosts in A Christmas Carol. The past, present and future all converged on poor Scrooge in an effort to save him from his own narrow vision of the world and wake him to the wonders of the life right before his eyes.

As we navigate the frantic pace of this holiday season we, like Scrooge, might stop to let the past, present and future converge on us for the same reason. Luckily we don't need any scary spectral visitations on Christmas Eve. All we have to do is step outside and let the night sky transport us back in time.

So put on your coats, and your gloves and don't forget your scarf because you can't rush this. The truth of time — your time — will take a moment to sink in.

Once you get out there your job is to find a star and focus on it for a second. Now here is a question: Are you seeing that distant sun as it is now, right now?

The answer, of course, is no. We never see the sky as it is, but only as it was.

The speed of light is not infinite. That means it takes time for light travel across space. So when you stare into the depths of the night sky, like looking at a distant star, you are also looking back in time. Catch a glimpse of a relatively nearby star and you see it as it existed when the light left the star's surface, perhaps when Abe Lincoln was president (if the star is 150 light-years away). Some stars near the edges of our own galaxy are seen as they appeared when the last ice age was in full bloom.

Focusing on that one star, you are seeing directly into the past. The light from the star is a messenger from some other now that is long, long gone.

And here's another twist: All the other stars in the sky are at different distances, which means different depths in time — the one NOW you are experiencing, while seeing all those stars, is really made of almost infinite number of THENS.

This present moment, in other words, is made of a whole lot of pasts.

And you can't dismiss this ""over-lapping pasts making the present"" thing as some kind of astronomy weirdness. Nope, it's the fabric of everything you experience. When you look at a mountain peak 30 km away, you see it not as it exists now but as it existed a 1/10,000 of a second ago. The light fixture three meters above your head is seen not as it exists now but as it was a hundred-millionth of a second ago. Gazing into your child's eyes you see her not for who she is now, but for who she was a 10-billionth of a second in the past.

All those different past moments converge on you to create what your seeing now, what your experiencing now.

The simple physical fact that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light means all of us — every man, woman and child — share the same predicament. We are all profoundly separated and yet deeply connected at the same time. This is our fundamental truth.

And just as Scrooge's initially frightening ghosts were actually messengers of hope, the deepest truths of science and the infinite night are there for us as well. What else can we do but live with compassion and reverence and joy.

"Updated at 6:09 p.m. ET

A gunman holed up in a hotel room high above the Las Vegas Strip fired down upon thousands of people attending a music festival Sunday night, in a brutal attack blamed for at least 59 deaths, a law enforcement official says. In the mass shooting and panic that ensued, 527 people were injured.

At least one of the dead is an off-duty police officer who was attending the concert. The suspect is also dead. Police say they're still trying to learn what could have motivated such an attack.

The sound of gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest festival concert was reported around 10:08 p.m. local time Sunday, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said at a news briefing. He identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock — a 64-year-old white male who is a resident of Nevada — and said the suspect was acting as a ""lone wolf.""

Responding to reports by the ISIS-associated news agency Amaq that the terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the attack — and that Paddock had converted to Islam — FBI Las Vegas Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse said on Monday that the agency has ""determined, to this point, no connection with an international terrorist group.""

Paddock fired down at the crowd of more than 22,000 people from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, according to the Las Vegas police department. A SWAT team used an explosive to breach the room, Lombardo said, and when police entered, they ""found the suspect dead."" Police say they believe Paddock killed himself.

It's 6:40 am, and there is a line out the door and around the block. People waiting to donate blood at United Blood Services. #RJ pic.twitter.com/sGRMpUOHXc

Lombardo said ""in excess of 10 rifles"" were found in the room; he did not identify the guns other than to call them rifles. He later added that information suggests the suspect had been in the hotel room since Thursday.

The violence is now being called the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, and the tragic death toll seems likely to rise. Forty-nine victims were killed in the June 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

In an update delivered just before 9 a.m. local time, Lombardo said police at the Las Vegas Village concert venue across the street from the Mandalay Bay hotel face a ""long process of body recovery out there, and evidence recovery and evidence documentation.""

Sheriff Lombardo shared the number of a missing persons hotline that people can call to check on their loved ones: 1-866-535-5654.

Local officials also asked people to donate blood through United Blood Services — and a massive response followed, with long lines prompting the service to deploy mobile donation vehicles and open more facilities to the public. Others showed up to offer water and snacks to people waiting in line, local Fox 5 News reports.

Loading...

""What we ask for is blood,"" Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said, recalling the offers of help that have followed the assault on residents and visitors to the tourist hub. ""Please donate blood.""

Goodman called the gunman ""a crazed lunatic"" who carried out an ""outrageous"" attack that runs counter to her city's values.

Images and video from the Las Vegas Strip are harrowing. They show masses of people screaming and trying to seek safety as torrents of gunshots echo through the concert area. Witnesses said that at first they thought the gunshots were fireworks. After the danger became clear, several said, they were still unsure where to run — because they couldn't see where the bullets were coming from.

Two on-duty police officers were injured during the shooting, the department says, adding, ""One is in stable condition after surgery and the other sustained minor injuries.""

""Obviously this is a tragic incident, and one that we've never experienced in this valley,"" Lombardo said. The goal now, he said, was to ""get our first responders back on their feet"" and conduct a full investigation.

President Trump said via a tweet, ""My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!""

Later, in a White House address delivered shortly before 11 a.m. ET, Trump said he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. He also said he has ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff.

""In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one — and it always has,"" Trump said.

Little is known about the suspected gunman. As Casey Morell of member station KNPR reports about Paddock, ""He lived in a town called Mesquite — which is about 90 minutes north of Las Vegas"" in Clark County.

Investigators ""have conducted a search warrant"" at Paddock's residence, the Mesquite Police Department said. Lombardo later added items were taken from the house, and that an additional property will also be searched.

Paddock seems not to have had a criminal record. ""The only thing we can tell is he received a citation several years ago and that citation was handled as a matter of normal practice in the court system,"" Lombardo said.

In the initial hours after the shooting, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said police were looking for Paddock's female companion, Marilou Danley. Early Monday, the department said, ""we are confident we have located the female person of interest"" — but they later clarified that they believe she was not involved. Lombardo says she was found ""out of the country"" and that Paddock had used some of her identification.

Police have also located two vehicles associated with Paddock: a Hyundai Tucson and a Chrysler Pacifica.

A Jason Aldean concert was underway at the time of the shooting. On social media, Aldean said he and his crew are safe. In an Instagram post, he called the shooting ""beyond horrific.""

The mass shooting prompted panic and a lockdown at hotels along the Strip, as a barrage of gunfire rained down on the crowd.

Musician Jake Owen, who played on the same stage as Aldean earlier Sunday night, told CBS News that the stream of gunfire seemed to go on for at least six minutes and possibly as many as 10. He took shelter behind a car with a crowd of other people, he said.

The Associated Press describes the scene:

""Concert-goers reported seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino across Las Vegas Boulevard from the country music festival and the sound of what they described as automatic gun fire.

""Witnesses said they saw multiple victims as they fled the gunfire raining down on the concert venue.

""Some later huddled in the basement of the nearby Tropicana hotel-casino.

""Some officers took cover behind their vehicles while others carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.""

Tens of thousands of people attended the weekend-long Route 91 Harvest festival. Aldean was headlining the final night of the three-day concert; the festival schedule called for him to go on stage just before 10 p.m.

Flights in and out of nearby McCarran International Airport were temporarily halted, but some flights resumed early Monday.

The killing of dozens of innocent people has prompted questions about how to define the horrible crime — particularly whether it could most accurately be called domestic terrorism.

When asked about that distinction, Lombardo said, ""We have to establish what his motivation is first. And there's motivating factors associated with terrorism other than a distraught person just intending to cause mass casualties.""

NPR's Leila Fadel says Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill described the shooting as an act of ""domestic terrorism.""

Paddock's brother Eric, who lives in Orlando, Fla., says the family doesn't know why Paddock might carry out a deadly shooting.

""We have absolutely no idea whatsoever,"" Eric Paddock said to reporters gathered outside his home Monday morning. ""We have no idea why he did this. And that's what you're going to find out. I can't imagine. When you guys found out why this happened, let us know. I have no idea whatsoever.""

Visibly distraught, Eric Paddock said the family sends its condolences to everyone affected by the attack. He said he was ""dumbfounded"" after being told that his brother had killed dozens of people. As for the guns Stephen Paddock reportedly used, Eric Paddock noted that his brother doesn't have a military background and asked, ""Where the hell did he get automatic weapons?""

Eric Paddock described the suspect as someone who gambled in Las Vegas casinos, enjoyed burritos, and dated a woman who sent cookies to their mother. The last contact between the two, he said, was when Stephen Paddock texted to check on his family after Hurricane Irma hit Florida.

City and county officials have set up a GoFundMe campaign to support victims and their families, Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak said. The campaign has a goal of $500,000; within three hours, it had raised nearly half that amount — with the total spiking after Sisolak mentioned it in a morning TV briefing.

"When people in several North Carolina precincts showed up to vote last November, weird things started to happen with the electronic systems used to check them in.

""Voters were going in and being told that they had already voted — and they hadn't,"" recalls Allison Riggs, an attorney with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.

The electronic systems — known as poll books — also indicated that some voters had to show identification, even though they did not.

Investigators later discovered the company that provided those poll books had been the target of a Russian cyberattack.

There is no evidence the two incidents are linked, but the episode has revealed serious gaps in U.S. efforts to secure elections. Nine months later, officials are still trying to sort out the details.

It all began shortly after polls opened at 6:30 a.m. on Election Day in Durham County. North Carolina was a key battleground state in a presidential race in which Russian interference was already a huge concern.

Riggs was working at a nonpartisan voter hotline at the time and says the complaints poured in. Alarmed, she contacted election officials to find out what was going on.

""We had roughly six precincts call and report computer-related issues,"" says Durham County Elections Director Derek Bowens. He says the problems were confined to a few laptops that the county used to run the poll book software.

When people come in to vote, poll workers use the system to confirm they are properly registered and record that they've cast their ballots.

At first, the county decided to switch to paper poll books in just those precincts to be safe. But Bowens says the State Board of Elections & Ethics Enforcement got involved ""and determined that it would be better to have uniformity across all of our 57 precincts and we went paper poll books across the county.""

That move caused a whole new set of problems: Voting was delayed — up to an hour and a half — in a number of precincts as poll workers waited for new supplies. With paper poll books, they had to cut voters' names out and attach them to a form before people could get their ballots.

""Precincts didn't have scissors, they didn't have tape, they didn't have glue sticks,"" says Riggs. As far as she was concerned, the solution was worse than the problem, and the state had overreacted.

But Susan Greenhalgh, who is part of an election security group called Verified Voting, worried that authorities underreacted. She was monitoring developments in Durham County when she saw a news report that the problem poll books were supplied by a Florida company named VR Systems.

""My stomach just dropped,"" says Greenhalgh.

Earlier, she had seen news reports about the FBI having warned Florida election officials in September that Russians had tried to hack one of their vendor's computers. Greenhalgh also spoke with a local elections official  who was on the call with the FBI. VR Systems was rumored to be the company. 

""I became really concerned that this might be a cyberattack, some sort of cyber event,"" says Greenhalgh.

But she had trouble getting anyone's attention. Greenhalgh says a contact she had at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was concerned but said there was little federal officials could do unless the state requested help.

Obama administration officials, who knew that Russians had already tried to tamper with election systems in a number of states, had an elaborate plan in place to respond to any major Election Day disruptions or cyberattacks.

Anthony Ferrante, who was in charge of cyber incident response at the National Security Council at the time, says federal authorities were monitoring voting on Nov. 8 from several command posts, including the one where he worked at the White House.

Ferrante says Durham County's voting problems drew attention, and the federal government was ready to help — but only if the state asked. It was a delicate matter, because U.S. elections are run by state and local governments and there were already fears on the local level that the federal government might interfere in the name of security.

""States were very adamant about declaring their independence from the federal government with respect to the 2016 election and, of course, we respected that,"" says Ferrante. ""However, we wanted to make sure we were prepared and assets were available in the event that states did call us for assistance.""

North Carolina didn't call for aid. Instead, officials assured federal authorities that things were under control and that they had switched to the paper poll books.

The problem was, on Election Day, the state was operating with limited information. It was unaware that Russian hackers had tried to break into VR Systems, which provided the poll books for 21 North Carolina counties.

A leaked top secret National Security Agency report suggested the Russian cyberattack took place in August 2016. It didn't become public until June of this year — and state officials were never told about it.

""We found out like everybody else did,"" says Josh Lawson, general counsel for the state board of elections.

Lawson says the state first learned of the hack attempt when The Intercept, an online news site, published its story detailing Russian attempts to hack VR Systems. The leaked report said hackers then sent emails to local election offices that appeared to come from VR — but which actually contained malicious software.

Lawson says there is no evidence that anyone in North Carolina received those fake emails. But, he adds, ""It's our job to be paranoid about this.""

""When you have a leaked memorandum indicating that there may have been a vulnerability about which you were not aware at the time, you're going to want to try to confirm that there was no actual interference.""

So now, months after the election, the state has launched an investigation into what happened in Durham County. It has secured the poll books that displayed the inaccurate information so forensic teams can examine them.

For his part, county Elections Director Bowens says voters should feel confident that the election was secure and that no vote counts were affected.

The county conducted its own investigation in November and determined that VR Systems' software had not failed. Some poll books had not been updated with the latest software, so they were displaying outdated voter information.

""The conclusion was that it was administrative errors that caused the issues on Election Day,"" says Bowens.

That may very well turn out to be the case, but the episode has left all parties frustrated.

VR Systems says that it agrees with the county's findings and that the problem was due to human error. Ben Martin, the company's chief operating officer, notes that no other county in the state had problems with VR Systems' poll books on Election Day. He also says the company warned its customers to be on the lookout for the fake emails when it became aware of them right before the election.

It's not clear how widely that information was shared.

Martin also insists that the hackers were unable to break into the company's computers, even though the leaked NSA intelligence report concludes that it's likely they did.

Attorney Allison Riggs warned that the decision to use paper poll books caused the kind of chaos at the polls that many analysts worry is the real motive behind Russia's hacking attempts. Riggs was able to get a court order to extend voting hours in the problem precincts but is worried about officials' future responses to what might just be a minor technical glitch.

""You want to be safe, absolutely,"" she says. "" But you also want to have a measured, appropriate response that doesn't exacerbate the chaos or effect of whatever may be the problem.""

State election officials say they would be much better prepared to respond if they have more reliable information. Lawson says federal intelligence officials have still not confirmed to the state that Russians tried to hack into VR Systems' computers or whether North Carolina is one of 21 states that federal officials have publicly revealed were targeted for attack last year.

Matt Masterson, who chairs the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, understands why everyone is frustrated.

""As information has come out in various media reports, election officials, I think fairly, have said, 'Why are we reading about this? Why has no one shared this information with us?' "" he says. ""Moving forward, that can't be the case. The election officials need to be in the know, need to be receiving this information.""

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security declared elections part of the nation's critical infrastructure.

Masterson says state and federal authorities are meeting to trying to figure out exactly what this means in practical terms and how they'll work together sharing intelligence and other information.

Masterson says the goal is to reach some agreements soon because everyone expects the Russian hackers will be back.

In the audio of this story, as well as an earlier Web version, we report that Susan Greenhalgh ""knew that in September, the FBI had warned Florida election officials that Russians had tried to hack one of their vendor's computers."" Greenhalgh's information was based on several news reports last fall and a discussion she had with one of the local election officials who participated in the call with the FBI. A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, which manages elections in the state, says there was ""an informational call with the FBI ... where they alerted officials for the need to maintain security measures, but there was no indication of a Florida-specific issue.""

"Twelve journalists have been murdered in Mexico this year, the latest Tuesday while at his 6-year-old son's school Christmas pageant. We explore why Mexico is such a dangerous place for journalists.

RAY SUAREZ, HOST: 

Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist. That fact was underscored yesterday. Gumaro Perez Aguilando, a local crime reporter, was shot and killed while attending a Christmas party at his son's elementary school in the city of Acayucan. He appears to be the 12th journalist killed in Mexico this year. NPR's Carrie Kahn is based in Mexico City and joins us now to talk about why it's such a risky place to work as a reporter. Carrie, good afternoon.

CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good afternoon, Ray.

SUAREZ: Tell us more about this latest killing.

KAHN: Oh, it's terrible. This man, Gumaro Perez, was at his son's elementary school. They were holding the end-of-the-year Christmas party. Dozens of parents and children were there at the time the gunman came in and shot Perez. This all took place in a town not far from the coast in the southern state of Veracruz. And Veracruz is the deadliest place for journalists in all of Mexico. Perez was enrolled in a state protection program for journalists there. A spokesperson for that program said he had been in the program since 2015 but hadn't spoken to them lately about any threats.

SUAREZ: Do authorities have any suspects in mind? And what is it that makes Veracruz more dangerous for reporters than other Mexican states?

KAHN: As usual, authorities don't mention suspects or motives, but what usually happens is they try to negate that the murder had anything to do with being a journalist. They'll say things like the victim had personal problems. So far, there have been no statements about Perez yet. The conventional wisdom in journalist killings is that it's drug traffickers or organized crime upset about what they're writing. With nearly none of these cases ever solved, it's hard to say who killed them. But in a state like Veracruz where official corruption is at an all-time high, increasingly reporters are writing about politicians, high-profile businessmen in their nexus with organized crime and drug cartels. So there are many actors that are thought to be involved in these killings now.

SUAREZ: 2017 was a particularly tough year for journalists in Mexico, and then there have been some very high-profile killings. Reporters Without Borders says murders of media workers were down this year, but that drop has not extended to Mexico, too.

KAHN: Yeah, that's true. This year has been an extremely violent one in Mexico. For 2017, we get these stats each month, and each month they say this is the highest number of homicides they've had since they started keeping murder statistics. We're talking about 2,000 killings a year, and reporters seem to be getting caught up in that overall violence, too. And a lot of the violence has been tied to increased corruption, a lot too with the fracturing of drug trafficking groups. And these fractured, smaller gangs are thought to be leaderless, less organized and much more violent.

SUAREZ: So what does this do to the work of reporters in Mexico in general? How can they do their job in this environment, and are many of them just leaving the profession, pulling their punches or leaving the country altogether?

KAHN: Yeah, they are, all of those things. It's a difficult time to be a journalist in Mexico. Even those that had connections to foreign press - and I'll just give you two examples - Miroslava Breach in the state of Chihuahua by the border and Javier Valdez who worked in the capital of Sinaloa. He was just an amazing, great journalist, and he was a great collaborator with all of us in the foreign press corps, recognized internationally for his work, and we all thought - and he did too - that that would protect him, but it didn't. He was gunned down on the street just a block from his office. I went to his funeral this year, and hundreds poured out with respect for him. It was really heartbreaking. And a lot of journalists, and especially those at his paper, say they're going to go on. They won't be silenced.

SUAREZ: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn. Thanks a lot.

KAHN: You're welcome.

"Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, is under fire after making the false claim that Bowling Green, Ky., was the scene of a massacre carried out by Iraqis. Conway made the claim in an MSNBC interview that aired Thursday night, in which she argued in favor of President Trump's immigration and refugee ban.

In trying to make her case, Conway also accused the media of not covering a massacre on U.S. soil that was perpetrated by terrorists posing as refugees. Friday morning, Conway suggested in a tweet that the claim had been an honest mistake.

1/2: Honest mistakes abound. Last night, prominent editor of liberal site apologized for almost running a story re: tweet from fake account

The city of Bowling Green says it appreciates the clarification, with Mayor Bruce Wilkeson stating, ""I understand during a live interview how one can misspeak.""

In the interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Conway defended Trump's order to freeze the flow of travelers and refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. The travel ban, Conway said, is ""narrowly proscribed, and also temporary,"" and is aimed at making America safer.

The senior member of Trump's staff, who is credited with introducing the concept of ""alternative facts"" to America's discourse, then said:

""I bet, there was very little coverage — I bet it's brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized — and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. I mean, most people don't know that because it didn't get covered.""

In this case, as a growing number of people are pointing out, most people don't know that purported ""new information"" because it describes something that did not transpire.

Saddened and sickened by Frederick Douglass' silence surrounding the Bowling Green Massacre.

Conway's claim is being ridiculed on Twitter and elsewhere, with fake tributes emerging to honor the nonexistent tragic event. Some of them invoke the hashtag #JeSuisBowlingGreen, playing off of expressions of empathy over actual terrorist attacks that transpired in recent history.

The remarks also briefly set off confusion over whether Conway was referring to Bowling Green, Ky. (home of Western Kentucky University) or Bowling Green, Ohio (home of Bowling Green State University), some 400 miles away.

I was a student at BGSU when the Bowling Green Massacre didn't happen. I'll never be able to not forget what I didn't see that day.🙏

Friday morning, the White House adviser tweeted that she was referring to the town in Kentucky, along with a link to an article about Iraqis arrested on terrorism charges in 2011.

We'll note that no Iraqi has carried out a deadly attack in the U.S. since the U.S.-led invasion of their country in 2003, though many Iraqis were involved in the insurgency that killed American troops. And as NPR's Greg Myre has reported, Trump's list of nations whose citizens are barred from entering the U.S. ""doesn't include any countries from which radicalized Muslims have actually killed Americans in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001.""

As criticism poured forth Friday morning, Conway said in a tweet, ""Honest mistakes abound.""

That statement highlights a dilemma in today's America: When public officials become known for promoting inaccuracies — and fake news is blamed for misinforming people — the task of distinguishing honest mistakes from calculated misstatements becomes more complex.

This morning, Conway also complained that an NBC reporter had contacted her about a separate story — but hadn't asked her to clarify her remarks about Bowling Green.

""Not cool, not journalism,"" she wrote. In another tweet that soon followed, she wrote, ""Honest mistakes abound.""

NBC reporter texted me at 632am re:a diff story; never asked what I meant on @Hardball b4 slamming me on @TODAYshow Not cool,not journalism

Setting aside Conway's claim of a massacre, the more widely accepted version of a known refugee-related national security event in Kentucky goes something like this: Two Iraqi men who entered the U.S. as refugees and lived in Bowling Green were arrested in 2011 and charged with supporting a terrorist group.

Despite acquiring Stinger missiles, guns and explosives that they believed to be real, neither Waad Alwan nor Mohanad Hammadi planned an attack in Kentucky; instead, they tried to send the weapons and money to al-Qaida in Iraq. And rather than being radicalized in the U.S., both men admitted to being involved in IED attacks on U.S. vehicles in Iraq.

At the time, national security experts said the case revealed ""an alarming gap in the screening process"" for refugees, as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported.

""U.S. Homeland Security officials say the Alwan case exposed gaps in the screening process at the start of the Obama administration,"" Johnson reported in 2011 (when they were arrested, both men had been in the U.S. for around two years). ""Nowadays, they say, applicants undergo a lot more scrutiny, and their names are run through more terrorist watch lists and other intelligence databases.""

In 2013, Alwan and Hammadi were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences — a life term for Hammadi and a 40-year term for Alwan.

""Both defendants were closely monitored by federal law enforcement authorities in the months leading up to their arrests,"" the Justice Department said. ""Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States.""

As for Conway's claim that President Obama declared ""a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program,"" a look at the events of 2011 shows that after the terrorism arrests, the administration slowed down but did not halt the process.

The White House was criticized that summer for what The New Yorker called an ""excruciatingly slow"" process of approving Iraqis' visas. At the end of the year, the State Department said it had admitted more than 9,300 Iraqis — half the number of the previous year. Part of that slowdown was blamed on tighter security screenings that began at the start of 2011.

"The political bomb that went off recently when Donald Trump Jr. revealed he met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer in hopes of getting damaging information about Hillary Clinton has raised new questions about the Trump family's connections to Russia.

And investigators are looking for clues in what might seem like an unlikely place: the glitzy November 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

It was there that Trump — then the pageant's owner — spent several days hobnobbing with Russia's elite and getting to know a wealthy developer whose connections his son would later seek to capitalize on.

According to an email released last week by Donald Trump Jr., the developer, billionaire Aras Agalarov, offered to pass on information about Clinton from Russia's top prosecutor to help the Trump campaign. He denies the charge.

Trump was already well known in Russia when he decided to bring the pageant to Moscow.

""Everyone wanted to meet him, of course. He was like a big deal, and I'm pretty sure in Russia he was already a TV personality, so he was already famous,"" said Gabriel Rivera-Barraza, a New York-based publicist who served as a preliminary judge at the pageant.

The contest would be held at Crocus City Hall, a venue owned by Agalarov. The event would be a family affair: Agalarov's son, a pop singer named Emin, performed on stage and his wife was a judge.

The Agalarov family's involvement appears to have helped create some buzz for the pageant.

""Agalarov is somebody who's well connected. He would have been able to produce a lot of important people to come and watch the Miss Universe pageant,"" said Kathryn Stoner, a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.

Trump himself would later boast about the many highfliers he met in Moscow, during a 2015 appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show.

""I was with the top level people, both oligarchs and generals and top-of-the-government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you I met the top people,"" Trump said.

For a while at least, it even appeared that Russian President Vladimir Putin might show up.

""There was certainly excitement within the organization, because the way that it had been described to us was that there was the likelihood that Putin would be attending,"" said MSNBC host Thomas Roberts, who emceed the event.

""We had to be certainly very careful. I was not allowed to make any type of political statement or go rogue,"" Roberts also said.

The pageant even warned Roberts and his co-host, Mel B of the Spice Girls, not to attempt to say any Russian words because a mispronunciation might offend Putin, Roberts added.

Trump himself seemed thrilled at the prospect of Putin attending, wondering in a tweet, ""Will he become my new best friend?""

Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?

In fact, Trump would even brag that he already had ""a relationship"" with Putin, during an interview in Moscow with Roberts. ""I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today,"" Trump said. ""He's probably very interested in what ... I am saying today, and I'm sure he's going to be seeing it in some form.""

In the end, Putin was unable to attend because of a last-minute visit from the King of the Netherlands. But Putin reportedly later sent Trump a gift — through Agalarov's daughter.

Trump would also stay on good terms with the Agalarov family, appearing in a music video with Emin and sending him a videotaped greeting on his 35th birthday.

Last week, Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer he was told had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. He said the meeting — which was also attended by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort — was arranged by an acquaintance from the pageant later identified as music promoter Rob Goldstone.

In a subsequently released email, Goldstone was quoted telling the president's son that the information had been passed on to Aras Agalarov from Russian prosecutor-general Yuri Chaika.

The revelations have raised new questions about the extent of the president's ties to the Agalarovs and generated more speculation about the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.

""We would like to know what happened on that trip, whether... he met with any Russians connected to Russia's intelligence service, and also to clear up just when did he meet with Vladimir Putin?"" said Swalwell, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee.

""By his own words during the campaign he said he had met with Putin, and when confronted, when Russia later became an issue, he backed away from that. So I think getting more clarity on that would be helpful to us,"" Swalwell said.

"There's a new narrative solidifying in Washington: President-elect Donald Trump distrusts the U.S. intelligence community because it's been sounding the alarm on Russia's interference in the November election. In turn, this feeds a growing sense of dread among U.S. intelligence professionals that the president-elect and his inner circle will ignore or undermine the intelligence community at every opportunity.

The ""Intelligence"" briefing on so-called ""Russian hacking"" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!

The intelligence community certainly has reason to be concerned. Trump's goal to slash and restructure the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence was reported by the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, the same day the president-elect raised doubts about U.S. intelligence in a tweet citing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

A day earlier, Trump elicited alarm after he tweeted disparagingly about a classified briefing he is due to receive this week.

Julian Assange said ""a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta"" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!

But it's doubtful there will be a major conflagration between the president and the national security bureaucracy during the Trump administration. The intelligence community is likely to back down from a major conflict with its boss, the president, and its overseers, Congress — because the disincentives to upset one's superiors are so numerous and ingrained.

This is not the first time the intelligence community in general, or the CIA in particular, has faced scorn — or worse — from a president or president-elect. Richard Nixon famously disliked the CIA and was skeptical of its analysis. Nixon once told his Director of Central Intelligence James Schlesinger, ""Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."" Within three months, Schlesinger pushed out 10 percent of the workforce.

Following the 1975-76 Church Committee investigation of the CIA for spying on anti-Vietnam War activists, President Jimmy Carter's fellow U.S. Naval Academy classmate, Adm. Stansfield Turner, dismissed hundreds of agency employees in a mass firing dubbed the ""Halloween Massacre"" of 1979. (Turner later reflected in his memoir, ""In retrospect, I probably should not have effected the reductions of 820 positions at all, and certainly not the last 17."")

Yet the agency survived to fight another day.

The intelligence community has traditionally served as a convenient scapegoat when policymakers' decisions go south. There's an old saw in Washington: In this town, there are only two possibilities: policy success and intelligence failure.

We think of the Iraq WMD debacle primarily as an intelligence failure. And Trump's communications staff certainly thinks so, as it resurrected the issue to dismiss a Dec. 9 Washington Post report that the CIA had assessed that Russia was trying to help Trump win the White House.

""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the Trump statement said.

But remember, it was a policymaker's decision to actually go to war in Iraq.

So the intelligence community has played this role of whipping boy before and will very likely continue to play it in the Trump administration.

And there probably won't be a showdown. People will grumble, but will go back to work. Most intelligence collection and analysis is a job as potentially interesting or humdrum as anyone else's. Despite the classified nature of the ""industry,"" people still collect data, type on computers, fill out forms and try to make sense of the world around them.

One can often forget that the intelligence community is made up of professionals who lead regular lives. Sure, they hold top-secret clearances, but they have mortgages and car payments, lawns to mow, children to take care of, vacations to plan. They are civil servants with a secure, middle-class American lifestyle that would be jeopardized if they quit their jobs.

That said, there may be some who could try to undermine Trump by leaking embarrassing documents and committing criminal acts in the process. Certainly in an industry where millions of people hold security clearances, there will be some who could try unilaterally to take action (how's January in Russia, Edward Snowden?) to effect change or cause disruption.

A few people might also just quit in protest. But those willing to do this to stick it to the president are few and far between. Most people will not throw away their life's work.

Still, there's a large exception that may arise if the president asks the intelligence community to do something that is clear-cut illegal and immoral — say, commit obvious war crimes.

On the campaign trail, Trump claimed that ""torture works"" and said he favored tactics like killing the families of terrorists. He later appeared to flip-flop on torture after discussing it with his defense secretary nominee, Gen. James Mattis. But if he changed his mind again, it would, of course, be members of the military or the intelligence community who would carry out these deeds.

And in such a case, all bets are off. Treat the intelligence community badly — well, that's par for the course. But if the events of the last 15 years have taught this generation of intelligence professionals anything, it's that one's sacred honor might be sacrificed for reasons beyond one's control.

Assuming there is no white-hot conflagration between the new president and the intelligence community, a slow degrading of our intelligence capacity during a time of unprecedented global challenges may be a more likely — and worse — long-term outcome.

The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, recently noted that right now, America is ""facing the most complex and diverse array of global threats that I've seen in my 53 years or so in the intel business.""

Perhaps otherwise motivated intelligence officers with specialized skills will redirect their energies into other careers if they disagree with the direction of a Trump administration. The CIA publicly acknowledged in 2015 that it continues to struggle, despite numerous years of trying, to recruit and retain minority officers.

If there's, say, real anti-Muslim or anti-Hispanic sentiment sweeping through the intelligence community because of the words and deeds of senior leadership, talented people will vote with their feet, ultimately damaging our long-term national security.

So does this all end with a bang or a whimper? Or not at all?

Clapper is confident, because of the intelligence community's mission and professionalism, that it will be a ""pillar of stability"" during the presidential transition. We'll find out when the first national security crisis occurs under Trump's watch. And if the past is any indication, a crisis (or two or three) will explode soon after he takes the oath of office.

"On Saturday night, President Trump personally thanked Nicole Mincey on Twitter. Twitter users looked into her and uncovered an online identity linked to an online store. Her account appeared to belong to a bot, but Daily Beast reporter Ben Collins dug further to discover the real Nicole Mincey.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: 

What started out as the story of a Twitter bot has become much stranger. Over the weekend, President Trump retweeted a bit of praise from a Twitter user named Nicole. And as people online dug into Nicole's identity, they found clues suggesting she was not a real person. Ben Collins was one of those people digging. He's a reporter for The Daily Beast. And his story today has the intriguing headline, ""I Found Nicole Mincey, Trump's Biggest Twitter Fan. She Isn't A Bot, But She Has A Ton Of Secrets."" Hey, Ben.

BEN COLLINS: Hey, how you doing?

SHAPIRO: Good. So this account that the president retweeted, Nicole Mincey, had the handle @Protrump45. What were the first clues that this account was not what it claimed to be?

COLLINS: Oh, man, there were a lot of them. First of all, her profile picture was a stock photo. Now, that's not something you're allowed to do on Twitter. You're not allowed to impersonate someone else. And she sort of messed with the wrong stock photo company because the CEO of that stock photo company then went on a rampage finding all these people who were associated with her that were using stock photos as their profile pictures. So that was...

SHAPIRO: So it wasn't only her profile pic. A lot of her followers, people retweeting her were all using stock photos from the same company.

COLLINS: Yeah, people with extraordinarily similar biographies. They weirdly all blogged at ProTrump45. There were a lot of these people.

SHAPIRO: So yesterday everybody saw that and concluded, OK, this is just a front. These people are fake. But somewhere behind all that fakery was a real person. Who was it?

COLLINS: That's correct. Part of her name is Nicole Mincey. She is also a person from New Jersey who, just as @Protrump45 said she was, grew up in a tough situation, now goes to college. She claimed to be a black woman. Both were black women. I talked to the person who really truly has that identity. And then things got a little weird.

SHAPIRO: She said that she was part of a group and that group basically used the real details of her identity pretending it was her. Is that what happened?

COLLINS: She said that she was recruited because she posted pro-Trump memes on Instagram. And this group of people - she said their names were Lorraine and William - reached out to her and said, hey, do you want to blog for ProTrump45? Which is really honestly mostly just, like, a make America great again trinket website. So when she wasn't blogging for them, they were using her name to push pro-Trump messages under this larger house account. That's the one that was tweeted at by the president last week. Now, she says she had nothing to do with that Twitter app. These people stole her identity after working with her for months. But that story sort of started to unravel as I talked to her.

SHAPIRO: We should say that the Twitter account has been taken down. The tweet has been deleted. What did you take away from your conversation with this very real woman caught up in this very strange story?

COLLINS: I honestly don't know what to believe anymore. She gave me some phone numbers for some of these people that she claimed were Lorraine and William. All of them rang through. One of them rang through to a phone service that makes a free instant telephone number. She said that Lorraine was in Texas when the only person with Lorraine's full name is in Newark, not very far away from where she lives. There are a lot of fishy things about this, but no proof.

SHAPIRO: It sounds like you feel caught in a hall of mirrors where even the things that you think you've learned may or may not be true.

COLLINS: It is a staple of our time to feel this way 24/7 (laughter).

SHAPIRO: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. This is a staple of our time, you say. How does this fit into the larger world in which we live right now?

COLLINS: Yeah, nothing is really true, but everything is true all at once. I think what's fascinating about Nicole or whoever claims to be Nicole is that they kept posting these memes claiming that, you know, the mainstream media is full of fake news trying to feed you an agenda that isn't real. And when you try to get answers from these people about who they really are, you can't do it.

SHAPIRO: Why would somebody set up these potentially fake Twitter accounts?

COLLINS: It's money (laughter). By tweeting back at the president, you can see a lot of people's desire to buy a lot of trinkets and, like, tchotchkes and things involving Donald Trump and making America great again. And this was a lot of their marketing strategy at ProTrump45. They would tweet back at the president and link to mugs of liberal tears or deplorable lives matter T-shirts, things like that. There is money to be made from this. And also, the other, more important thing potentially is that faking support online for a bunch of political characters is, in fact, a lucrative business. You can - even if one person at the end of the day believes in Donald Trump, they can pretend to be, you know, hundreds or thousands of these people.

SHAPIRO: Daily Beast reporter Ben Collins speaking with us via Skype. Thanks a lot.

COLLINS: Thank you.

"Think before you snap that selfie.

That's the serious message of a joint campaign created by two groups that have spent the past few years poking fun at problematic photos taken by Western volunteers. They often have the tendency to paint themselves as saviors to needy people in low-income countries.

The campaign, launched this month, offers guidelines and a cheeky video to first-time travelers or young volunteers eager to capture every moment of their vacation or mission on Facebook or Instagram. It was created by Radi-Aid, a project of the Norwegian Students' and Academics' International Assistance Fund (SAIH) that fights stereotypes in aid and development, and by Barbie Savior, an Instagram parody account.

According to the campaigners, the selfie takers may not realize that their posts, from the photo to the caption to the hashtags, can perpetuate stereotypes and rob the subject of dignity or privacy. 

A seemingly innocent selfie with African kids, for example, can perpetuate the idea that only Western aid, charity and intervention can ""save the world,"" says Beathe Ogard, president of SAIH in Norway. These children are portrayed as helpless and pitiful, Ogard says, while the volunteer is made out to be the superhero who will rescue them from their misery.

Both Radi-Aid and Barbie Savior have gained a cult following for using satire and humor to tackle poverty porn, voluntourism and the white-savior complex. Radi-Aid, for example, made a viral video in 2016 titled ""Who Wants To Be A Volunteer?"" about a reality show whose grand prize is the chance to ""Save Africa!"" It has more than a million views.

Barbie Savior spoofs volunteer photography by recreating popular images using Barbie dolls and Photoshop. A recent entry portrayed Barbie sitting on a pit toilet. The caption: ""Did you know that 112 percent of the people living in the country of Africa don't have access to toilets? #squatitlikeitshot."" The account has more than 120,000 followers.

A post shared by Barbie Savior (@barbiesavior) on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:59am PST

Despite their efforts, Barbie Savior and Radi-Aid have continued to observe ""simplified and unnuanced photos playing on the white-savior complex, portraying Africa as a country, the faces of white Westerners among a myriad of poor African children, without giving any context at all,"" Ogard says. The proliferation of these posts, she suspects, is the result of social media becoming a big part of how we communicate.

That's what makes the guidelines so crucial, says Adeela Warley, CEO of CharityComms, a network of communications professionals working in U.K.-based nonprofits. ""In the age of instant communications, it's too easy to press 'go,' "" she says. ""You still see so many images that make [impoverished people] look passive and helpless as opposed to empowered. People need to take the time to think about the stories their [social media posts] are telling.""

Ogard and the co-founder of Barbie Savior, Emily Worrall, hope that the guide will make young volunteers and travelers more aware of what they're posting. Advice in the ten-point checklist includes: Be respectful of different cultures and traditions, avoid sweeping generalizations, challenge perceptions.

The campaigners also want photo-takers to question their own intentions. Are they just posting the photos for ""likes""?

Worrall recalls her own experience a decade ago. When she was 17, she went on a volunteer trip to Uganda. She shared photos of herself and the orphans she was helping with her family and friends. They showered her with praise. ""They told me, 'Wow, you're doing such amazing work.' They put me on a pedestal,"" she says. At the time, she didn't consider the children's privacy or vulnerability. Years later, it became inspiration for this Barbie Savior post:

A post shared by Barbie Savior (@barbiesavior) on Jan 1, 2017 at 11:51am PST

That image is one of many cliched visual tropes that Ogard and Worrall have observed. They shared examples of the kinds of photos volunteers should avoid when traveling to the developing world:

 These can give the viewer the impression that such small gestures can change a child's life when ""in reality it has no impact. A lot of these people make empty promises and never come back to the community,"" says Worrall, who has worked in Uganda as a development consultant for seven years. She recreated the image for Barbie Savior in August 2016.

 All the kids in the street run to greet us every morning. It is SO sweet. Ken and his bros gave this little bro-in-the-making high-fives all around and it made his day. It was pretty clear that it was the best moment of this little guy's life! #highfivestayalive #highfivebro #butactually #brofive #brohive #highfivesforHim #fiveinandsavin #blessup #fiveup #ahahahah #stayinafive #ithrowmyhandsupintheairsometimes #ayyo #imgunnasaveyo

A post shared by Barbie Savior (@barbiesavior) on Aug 20, 2016 at 6:06pm PDT

""We're constantly reproducing these images that have no respect for informed consent,"" Ogard says. ""In Norway, I would never show up at a school and take a selfie with kids playing.""

The campaigners illustrate this point in their animated video. The young volunteer takes a selfie with a sick child in a hospital bed while bored hospital staffers look on. ""It completely disregards the child's needs,"" Worrall says.

For years, communicators in the field of global development have been working to fight stereotype-reinforcing images in charity ads through awareness campaigns and codes of ethics. But few specifically address social media or are geared toward young people.

Susan Krenn is the executive director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Communication Programs, and her work centers on global development and public health programs overseas. While the university has a cultural orientation program for students traveling abroad, there are no hard and fast rules for how to portray their experience on social media. ""I have not seen a resource like this,"" she says of the guidelines. ""We'd use it. It's quite helpful, clear and easy.""

Ogard and Worrall don't want the guidelines to discourage volunteers from posting photos on social media. They just want photo-takers to reflect on what they're sharing. Ask for a subject's consent, they say. Show your social followers something different.

If you need inspiration, Worrall says, check out some of the positive imagery from charities that received a Golden Radiator award in Radi-Aid's annual contest for the best and worst charity ads. These ads, like those from an NGO called Mama Hope, show local people actively engaged in helping others in their community.

If you're staying with a family in a low-income environment and they allow you to take a photo with their children, use it as a ""great opportunity to challenge stereotypes,"" Worrall says. That might mean providing details and context — names, locations, personal stories — in an extended caption on social media.

And if a child gets excited when they see you pull out your tablet or smartphone and ask to take a photo with you, that doesn't mean it's OK to do so. ""It's a cop out to say, well, they want it,"" Worrall says. ""A child can't make that kind of decision.""

""Think of how they would view the photo if they found it at 25 years old,"" she adds. ""How would it make them feel?""

"Updated Dec. 1 at 5:01 p.m. ET

Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty Friday to providing false statements to the FBI. Those are less serious charges than he could have faced, because he is cooperating with special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigators.

Flynn likely has something to trade, as NPR's Carrie Johnson noted on All Things Considered Friday. Flynn was not acting alone, according to charging documents against him. In fact, there were multiple members of the presidential transition team who spoke with Flynn about his communications with the Russian ambassador.

That included a ""very senior member,"" who ""directed Flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia ..."" Several news organizations have identified that individual as Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law.

The Logan Act often comes up in relation to the Russia investigation. Back in February, we noted that Flynn himself could have violated it. But now that Mueller is looking up the food chain, we dug out and refreshed our post explaining what it is, why it matters — and why it is seldom used.

What is the Logan Act? 

The Logan Act states, in part (emphasis ours):

""Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.""

Let's break that down. This is saying that no private person can try to conduct foreign policy without the permission of the U.S. government.

Specifically, that person isn't allowed to talk with a foreign government or its representative and try to influence foreign policy — ""directly or indirectly.""

When was it put in place and why?

It's named for Dr. George Logan, a Democratic-Republican Party lawmaker from Pennsylvania, who traveled to France in 1798 and negotiated the lifting of an embargo and the release of American sailors held captive in French prisons.

He did so without the permission of President John Adams, though he was a friend of then-Vice President Thomas Jefferson's.

It was after the French Revolution, and the United States didn't help France because of a treaty with England. The French were upset and began robbing passing American ships and jailing its sailors.

Official Adams administration envoys tried unsuccessfully to settle the unrest with France — and the country appeared tumbling toward war with France. That's when Logan, a Quaker, embarked on his effort.

He succeeded, but when he got back to the U.S., Adams, Washington and others were furious. Congress then acted to bar actions like Logan's from taking place again.

Has anyone ever been convicted of violating it?

No.

This is important, because as often as this law is mentioned, no one has ever gone to jail for it, meaning the likelihood of its being used is pretty slim.

Why hasn't anyone been convicted?

Often, the people who get mentioned are people who are in government and seem to defy the sitting president. For example, remember when then-House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress?

Obama and Netanyahu had an icy relationship because of Israeli settlement expansion. (Ironic considering what the charging documents say Flynn did in trying to get Russia to vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution dealing with that very issue.)

So some people raised the Logan Act and whether Boehner was in violation. Most said no. Here's why, per the Washington Post:

""That's partly because the law is vague about which branch of government can give permission for someone to conduct foreign affairs, noted Eugene Volokh with The Volokh Conspiracy blog at The Post in 2015.

""It could be the executive branch, it could be Congress. It could even be the president telling just one member of Congress to go do something without telling the others. It seems like [there] are so many loopholes and uncertainties, it's hard for prosecutors to peg down how someone violated this law — and even harder for courts to make that determination.

""But the law is pretty clear that you need to have permission from the government to do something, and it doesn't look like Flynn had permission to talk to Russians about sanctions while the Obama administration was still in power.""

So has there ever been an attempt to prosecute someone for it? 

Yes, once someone was indicted.

That was way back in 1803, four years after the law was enacted.

An anonymous column ran in a Kentucky newspaper arguing for ""A Western America"" allied with France. The U.S. attorney for Kentucky was an Adams ally and persuaded a grand jury to indict Francis Flournoy, a farmer, who actually wrote the column.

But it never went to trial.

Later that year, the Louisiana Purchase, which expanded the United States farther west, made it moot.

How else has the Logan Act been used?

Mostly as a political weapon.

Various courts have mentioned the Logan Act, according to the Congressional Research Service, but it has mostly been used to try to shame political opponents.

For example, in the 1980s, there was House Speaker Jim Wright's relationship with the Sandinista government in Nicaragua — and Jesse Jackson negotiating in Syria and Cuba for prisoner releases.

""That is the law of the land,"" a frustrated President Ronald Reagan said in an interview in 1984 of the Logan Act and Jackson's efforts.

He added, ""We are not going to take legal action, but I do feel that while in this instance he was successful, there were things that make you pause and think.""

OK, that was the 1980s. Has it been mentioned more recently?

Yes, lots.

During the George W. Bush administration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a trip to Syria and talked about improving U.S.-Syria relations with that government, irritating the White House.

Former President Jimmy Carter also traveled to Syria in 2008 to meet with Hamas about Mideast peace.

As recently as 2015, the act was mentioned again when 47 Republican U.S. senators wrote a letter to Iran downplaying the nuclear deal. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has been rumored to be in line as Trump's next CIA director, penned the letter — and was accused of violating the act.

The potential of a Logan Act violation was raised again when Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii met with Syrian leader Bashar Assad in January of this year, before Trump was sworn in.

""I wanted to see if there was, in some small way, a way that I could express the love and the aloha and the care that the American people have for the people of Syria,"" she told CNN.

The Obama administration's official position was regime change in Syria. President Trump has said the U.S. should work with Russia to bring peace in Syria. Russia's policy is to leave Assad in place.

Could the ""very senior member"" be susceptible?

We noted in February that if Flynn, in any way, reassured the Russian ambassador in his phone conversations or texts that the incoming Trump administration would loosen or drop the sanctions Obama put in place, that could potentially be a violation.

That could be the same for whoever ""directed"" Flynn (or whoever directed the person who directed Flynn) if there was reassurance on sanctions.

The charging documents note that:

""Flynn and the PTT official discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. The PTT official and Flynn also discussed that the members of the Presidential Transition Team at Mar-a-lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.""

The charging documents do not make clear what Flynn urged exactly when it came to sanctions — if there was reassurance, for example. But there is a transcript of that call collected by the intelligence community, and presumably Mueller's team has reviewed it.

The White House said in February it was confident Flynn didn't say anything that violated the law.

""There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions,"" then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer contended after Flynn was fired in February.

The White House has not commented since Flynn's guilty plea.

"Advisory: The below songs contain explicit lyrics and profanity.

Lil Wayne's Dedication 6 is due to drop on Christmas Day, but Weezy Santa can't seem to keep his new music a secret. In addition to releasing two songs from the mixtape, he's previewed a third in the making — and from the sounds of it, the sixth installment of his long-running mixtape series will feature Wayne putting his own spin on some of hip-hop's biggest beats of 2017.

""Blackin Out,"" featuring Euro, finds Lil Wayne going in on Jay-Z's ""Story Of O.J."" Originally produced by No I.D., the track samples Nina Simone's classic ""Four Women."" His verse isn't quite as thematic as Jay-Z's racial diatribe, of course, but the New Orleans native known for his sick freestyles does his own version of blacking out on the mic.

""Bank Account"" features Wayne taking on Atlanta rapper 21 Savage's biggest hit from this year's Issa Album LP. It's the only song on 21 Savage's major-label debut that the rapper himself produced.

But the best remix from Wayne may be yet to come. A YouTube video snippet shows Wayne in the studio with an engineer as an instrumental of Kendrick Lamar's ""DNA."" is cued up. The song, produced by Mike WiLL Made-It, is one of the most explosive beats of 2017. Mike WiLL actually built the back half of the beat around an a cappella version of Lamar rapping frenetically, he told NPR Music in April.

""He was going so hard; that man was rapping so crazy,"" Mike WiLL said, ""and I had to build a beat around that. I didn't want the beat to just sound like a regular boom-clap, boom-clap. I wanted that s*** to sound just as crazy. I wanted it to sound like he's battling the beat.""

Guess we'll have to wait till Christmas morning to unwrap the rest of Lil Wayne's gift rap.

"Aurelie Garat still can't get over how she found her Pere Noel this year. She's the Christmas pageant organizer for the tiny Normandy town of Vimoutiers. 

""I was parking when I saw a nice young man with a beautiful beard sitting in his car on the phone,"" says Garat. ""So I said to him, your beard speaks to me. Would you be our Father Christmas this year?""

Garat says they had been looking everywhere and had almost given up hope. She says it was as if this Pere Noel — as the French call Santa Claus — had just fallen out of the sky.

That heaven-sent Santa is 66-year-old retired American photographer Tom Haley, who happens to be fixing up a house he recently bought near Vimoutiers. Haley says he wasn't actually so surprised by Garat's request.

""For the last several years now I'll be walking along in Paris or anywhere,"" he says, ""and kids will all of a sudden stop in their tracks like they see Santa Claus.""

After Haley is helped into a century-old red felt hood and cape, he takes his place in a carriage pulled by a donkey. He is surrounded by lots of children dressed as elves and characters from the French fairy tales of Charles Perrault.

With bells jingling, the joyous party sets off down the street. They are soon joined by an organ grinder.

Excited children wave from windows. Others stop and gape from the sidewalk. 

After a stop at the retirement home to give out chocolates and sing a few songs, the little pageant arrives in the town square. There's a Christmas market and a big comfy chair awaiting Pere Noel.

With a long line in front of him, Haley begins by taking each child on his knee.

Six-year-old Luna tells Haley she wants Barbie dolls.

There are other, less young residents of Vimoutiers who also visit Santa for a talk.

Eighty-eight-year-old Andree Boursier tells Haley she worked her whole life making cheese.

She refuses to sit in his lap, but assures him that she still believes in Pere Noel.

Haley has a connection to Normandy that goes back to his father, who landed here on D-Day plus two. He says in the 1990s he and his father returned and were able to find the farm where his company bivouacked.

""We knocked on the door and this older gentleman answered and I explained to him what we were doing there and that my father had landed on Omaha Beach,"" Haley says. ""And the guy just sort of broke down and grabbed my father in his arms and hugged him. I mean it was incredible.""

Today Vimoutier has a Muslim community. Many emigrated from Morocco in the decades after World War II. Loubna Sadkaoui has her children participate in the Christmas pageant because she thinks it's important to share in each other's holidays and cultures.

""It shows respect and tolerance,"" she says. ""When it's Ramadan people also celebrate with us.""

Sadkaoui says it's wonderful to have an American Pere Noel this year. It gives them another culture to celebrate.

"Last week, a small Montana company called Whitefish Energy Holdings announced that it had been given a $300 million contract by Puerto Rico's electricity authority to help restore the power grid on the island, where some 75 percent of customers remain without power.

The decision to award such a big contract — and such an enormous challenge — to a tiny company founded just two years ago has surprised many. Power companies don't generally use contractors to restore electricity but make arrangements for help from other utilities.

Puerto Rico's power grid was precarious even before Hurricane Maria made landfall a month ago. But since the storm, the problem is immense. It could take at least six months for service to be fully restored.

Whitefish Energy is tasked with rebuilding three to four transmission lines, or more than 100 miles of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's 2,500 miles of lines. Montana newspaper Flathead Beacon called it ""a windfall for the relatively untested"" company.

The firm's website offers little detail on the company or its track record. It's based in Whitefish, Mont., the hometown of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke. Its financing comes from two Dallas-based investment groups and a Brazilian company that produces distribution and power transformers.

A profile of the company on a site that tracks federal contracts lists Whitefish as having just two employees and $1 million in annual revenue.

So why was it given such a big, expensive job?

PREPA's chief executive officer, Ricardo Ramos, describes the choice as a matter of timing and convenience.

""We knew there was going to be a direct hit, so we wanted as much resources as possible,"" Ramos told NPR. ""Their name popped up on several fronts.""

Ramos says PREPA received bids from a few companies in the lull between Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. The utility, which filed for bankruptcy in July, shortlisted two, including Whitefish.

""Just before Hurricane Maria came, one of those two requested a payment guarantee that we thought was a bit onerous, so we decided to mobilize Whitefish,"" Ramos says.

Whitefish did not ask for a payment guarantee, and it got the contract with PREPA.

The company was picked because it was ""the only one who was willing to take on the job of restoring power for the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria,"" Margaret Jones of LDWW Group, a public relations firm representing Whitefish, wrote in an email. ""When they called and needed help – Whitefish went right to work.""

Usually after a catastrophic power outage, utility companies call a trade organization to initiate mutual aid. The American Public Power Association, of which PREPA is a member, organizes a network of state and regional public power utilities to restore electricity quickly.

Meena Dayak, the association's spokeswoman, tells NPR that the mutual aid program is ""basically a matchmaking service"" — utilities contract directly with one another to provide services and work out payment.

That's what happened in Texas after Harvey, and in Florida following Irma. The day after Irma's departure, Florida Power & Light said it had more than 20,000 workers from 30 states and Canada deployed to restore power.

But PREPA never asked for mutual aid from the association, and instead it hired Whitefish to handle the job.

""Just a matter of the timing,"" says Ramos. ""Hurricane came, all communications went down, our servers were down.""

Whitefish then subcontracted Jacksonville Electric Authority and Kissimmee Utility Authority to work with it on transmission system restoration. The firm says it now has about 300 workers on the ground. Even Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski reportedly noted that it's unusual for electrical utilities to work under a contractor.

PREPA's decision to contract Whitefish could be a costly one.

While the Whitefish spokeswoman says it's ""not possible at this time to estimate"" the cost of completing the work, the hourly wages the firm is reportedly charging for its contracted workers are eye-popping.

""Under the contract, the hourly rate was set at $330 for a site supervisor, and at $227.88 for a 'journeyman lineman,' "" The Washington Post reports. ""The cost for subcontractors, which make up the bulk of Whitefish's workforce, is $462 per hour for a supervisor and $319.04 for a lineman. Whitefish also charges nightly accommodation fees of $332 per worker and almost $80 per day for food.""

UTIER, the electrical workers' union of Puerto Rico, tweeted its consternation at those rates. ""We need support and help, but under these conditions it is impossible and questionable. Who allowed this?""

Necesitamos apoyo y ayuda pero bajo estas condiciones es imposible y cuestionable. Quien permitió esto? @AEEONLINE @ricardorossello pic.twitter.com/1gLHbBFmF4

The firm's spokeswoman told NPR that while this is Whitefish's first job in Puerto Rico, the company brings experience in maintaining and repairing transmission lines and working in mountainous regions. A recent project in Washington state included using helicopters in the rebuilding of a distribution line destroyed by forest fire, she said.

Techmanski told Bloomberg that while other utilities ""are all afraid of the question of how are we going to get paid, Whitefish Energy was the company that actually made the leap of faith and was able to get over here.""

On social media, Whitefish is energetic about its work, posting videos of a crewman dangling from a helicopter with exciting music in the background. But Whitefish also says it's having a hard time accessing work sites because of debris.

PREPA says it has paid Whitefish $2 million so far for its mobilization and work through Oct. 11. At least at the outset, Whitefish's bills will likely be paid with money from FEMA, which on Monday announced more than $215 million in assistance to PREPA. Whitefish could be paid up to $300 million for the work.

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told the Post that of the $490 million the commonwealth expects to spend on restoring power, ""a large portion of that would probably go to Whitefish"" and another contractor.

But Puerto Rico doesn't have money to burn. The commonwealth could run out of money as early as the end of the month, the Post reports.

The House Committee on Natural Resources told NPR Tuesday that it plans to discuss the contract at an upcoming hearing.

""The size and unknown details of this contract raises numerous questions,"" said Parish Braden, a committee spokesman. ""This is one of many things the committee is taking a close look at as it continues to work with the resident commissioner, governor's office, and oversight board to ensure Puerto Rico's recovery is robust, effective and sustained.""

Late Tuesday afternoon, Rosselló said he had ordered his Office of Management and Budget to audit the Whitefish contract and others made by PREPA for power restoration.

Contracts, Rosselló said, would have to both meet FEMA's standards and comply with the budget office's audit to ensure ""the processes have been carried out correctly in this and other circumstances.""

"In many ways, parenting newborns seems instinctual.

We see a little baby, and we want to hold her. Snuggle and kiss her. Even just her smell seems magical.

Many of us think breast-feeding is similar.

""I had that idea before my first child was born,"" says Brooke Scelza, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Los Angeles, California. ""I definitely thought, 'Oh, I'm going to figure that out. Like how hard can it be?' ""

Although breast-feeding is easy for some women, for many new moms — including Scelza — it's a struggle. ""I was shocked at how hard it was,"" she says.

In a survey a few years ago, 92 percent of women said they had problems in the first few days of breast-feeding. They couldn't get the baby to latch onto the nipple. They had pain. Sore nipples. And they were worried they weren't making enough milk.

""This is just surprising because breast-feeding was a critical function for child survival in the past, and if you couldn't figure it out, your infant was going to be in really big trouble,"" Scelza says.

It's almost like in the U.S. we've lost the breast-feeding instinct. That Western society has somehow messed it up. Scelza wanted to figure out why: What are we doing wrong? So a few years ago, she traveled to a place with some of the best breast-feeders in the world. In the desert of northern Namibia, there's an ethnic group that lives largely isolated from modern cities. They're called Himba, and they live in mud huts and survive off the land.  ""They're cattle herders basically,"" Scelza says. ""But they also have gardens where they grow maize, sorghum and pumpkins."" Moms still give birth in the home. And all moms breast-feed.

""I have yet to encounter a woman who could not breast-feed at all,"" Scelza says. ""There are women who have supply issues, who wind up supplementing with goat's milk, which is not uncommon. But there's basically no use of formula or bottles or anything like that.""

And Himba women make breast-feeding look easy, Scelza says. They even do it while they're walking around. ""So women will carry the babies with them on their backs, and then if the baby cries, they take the baby out, feed the baby and then put the baby on their back,"" she says.

Scelza and other anthropologists have come up with several hypotheses for why Himba women and women in other traditional cultures are so successful at breast-feeding.

One idea is that the mom and her newborn have long, uninterrupted contact right after birth. Since women are at home, there are no doctors and nurses whisking the infant away for weighing, fingerprinting or tests. This contact allows the newborn's suckling instincts to kick in, researchers have hypothesized.

""Farmers know that separation of mother and newborn farm animals results in ... an inability on the part of the baby to suckle,"" anthropologist Meredith Small writes in her book Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent.

""We have only recently become aware that human babies have the same sort of reflexes designed to seal the pact between mother and infant right after birth,"" Small continues. But if you take the baby away from the mom during the first hour or so, you can ""derail the whole process.""

The second hypothesis is that Himba women learn how to breast-feed throughout their childhood. Because women see their moms, siblings and friends breast-feed while growing up.

""Breast-feeding in public isn't stigmatized at all,"" Scelza says.

So by the time they have their own babies, Himba women know what to do and it appears instinctual. Here in the U.S. we hardly ever see mothers breast-feeding. So women never really learn.

Well, turns out both hypotheses aren't quite right. ""I'm telling you that's exactly what I thought was going on until I started to talk to Himba women,"" Scelza says.  A few years ago, Scelza interviewed 30 Himba women in depth about their experiences breast-feeding, especially in the first few days after birth. And guess what? Himba women are a lot like American women.

""Many of the women that I talked to actually struggled a lot with learning how to breast-feed,"" she says.

Two-thirds of the women said they had some problems at the beginning, such as pain, fear, troubles getting the baby to latch and concerns about the milk supply — just like American moms.

And their problems went beyond breast-feeding.

""Most women talked about having little knowledge about early infant care, such as how to hold babies or how to be sure they're sleeping safely,"" Scelza says.

So how do the Himba get over these problems? They have a secret weapon many American women don't, Scelza says: Grandmothers.

""When a woman gives birth, she typically goes home to her mother's compound in the last trimester of pregnancy and stays there for months after the birth,"" she says. And then the new mom's mom — the grandma — shows her everything she needs to know about breast-feeding and infant care.

""Their mothers actually sleep in the hut with them after birth and wake up the new mom and say, 'It's time to feed your baby! It's time to feed your baby!"" Scelza exclaims.

So it's really not that we've lost the natural instinct for breast-feeding. But instead we no longer have a grandma around 24/7 to be a teacher. We've lost the guidance. We've lost the support.

""As I started to read about this [Himba practice] you can find so many examples of this in so many cultures,"" Scelza says.

For example, there's a small ethnic group in the Ivory Coast, called Beng. In their community, a woman learns to breast-feed from other moms, anthropologist Alma Gottlieb describes in her book The Afterlife Is Where We Come From.

""During the first few weeks, a newly delivered woman — especially a first-time mother ... has a constant stream of visitors, particularly women,"" Gottlieb writes. ""Most have breast-fed many babies themselves, and they spontaneously share their nursing wisdom. Through them, a new mother is quickly socialized into accepting an almost continual round of breast-feeding suggestions dispensed by more experienced women.""

In many Asian cultures, women have traditionally practiced what's called ""sitting the month,"" or zuo yue zi in Mandarin. For 30 days, a woman stays confined in her home and is looked after by grandmothers, in-laws and aunts.

These women cook and help the new mom recover from giving birth. They also teach her how to breast-feed.

""Researchers often write about this period as a time for recuperation,"" Scelza says. ""But I'm increasingly interested in thinking it as critical period of learning for new moms.""

So it's no wonder American women struggle with breast-feeding. It would be strange if they didn't. Because women have problems breast-feeding everywhere. Moms have evolved to need help, to be taught.

""I think that there's enormous pressure to succeed with breast-feeding in the U.S. and that you feel like if you can't do it that this is a huge failing as a mother,"" Scelza says. But Himba women didn't seem to think the problems related to breast-feeding were a big deal.

""When [the baby] had trouble latching, they were just like, 'Yeah, this is part of what you have to learn if you're going to breast-feed,"" she says. ""They didn't stigmatize the failing.""

"Updated at 6:52 p.m. ET 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants 2018 to be a year of bipartisanship, even if that means moving on from GOP dreams of cutting welfare and fully rolling back the Affordable Care Act.

The Kentucky Republican on Thursday broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In an interview with NPR, McConnell said he is ""not interested"" in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats.

""I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,"" McConnell said. ""The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it.""

McConnell said he wants to spend much of next year focused on issues on which Republicans can work with at least some Democrats in the Senate.

""This has not been a very bipartisan year,"" McConnell said. ""I hope in the new year, we're going to pivot here and become more cooperative.""

Republicans spent most of the year struggling, and failing, to follow through on promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Democrats refused to work with Republicans while they were trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement, and McConnell hopes that next year will be different.

""Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,"" McConnell said. ""We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.""

McConnell is referring to the political reality that the odds for legislation with only GOP support become longer in January when Sen.-elect Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, takes office.

Republican demands to gut the ACA also declined after Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by zeroing out the tax penalty in Obamacare as part of the tax bill approved this week. McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.

""I think the repeal of the individual mandate takes the heart out of Obamacare,"" McConnell said. ""We want to steady the insurance markets if we can ... and I think we'll probably be addressing that part of health care sometime next year.""

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina immediately pushed back on McConnell's comments. ""To those who believe — including Senate Republican leadership — that in 2018 there will not be another effort to Repeal and Replace Obamacare — you are sadly mistaken,"" Graham said in a statement and on Twitter.

I’m fully committed to Repealing and Replacing Obamacare in 2018 by block-granting the money back to the states and away from Washington bureaucrats who are completely unaccountable to the patients of America.

After the major push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act over the summer, Graham joined with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to promote a bill that would deconstruct the programs that make up the ACA and hand the funds over to the states to run their own programs. It would have gotten rid of the law's subsidies that help low-income consumers purchase insurance and the expansion of Medicaid that it allowed.

McConnell also plans to spend much of the year persuading skeptical voters to embrace the GOP tax overhaul. Recent polls have shown that a majority of voters expect to pay more under the tax bill, a perception McConnell hopes to disprove in the coming months.

""I do think the coverage has been overwhelmingly negative, and it certainly has an impact on it,"" McConnell said. ""You take a family of four making $73,000 a year [that] will save about $2000. Now, to lot of people inside the Beltway that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but to that family, that's a 58 percent reduction in their tax bill.""

McConnell also expects bipartisan work will continue in the Senate probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. McConnell said he hopes the investigation will conclude in time to give voters confidence in the security of the elections process ahead of the midterm election in November.

""I'm looking forward to a recommendation from them, and I'm hoping that it will be a bipartisan recommendation,"" McConnell said. ""Because if it breaks into pure partisanship, no one's going to pay any attention to it.""

He also rejected the notion that President Trump is preparing to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. ""The only people that talk about that are the Democrats,"" McConnell said. ""But I don't hear anybody at the White House or any Republicans, and certainly not in the Senate, calling for Mueller to be fired.""

"The presidential election is long past, but online attacks aimed at shaping the U.S. information environment have kept right on coming.

This week brought a slate of fresh examples of ways in which users — some of them demonstrably Russian, others not — continue to try to use Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to jam a crowbar into existing American political divisions and wrench them further apart.

Oklahoma's Republican Sen. James Lankford cited the ongoing national debate over free speech and protest in the National Football League, which has set players who want to call attention to police brutality — and are demonstrating by kneeling during the national anthem — against President Trump and cultural conservatives.

""We watched, even this weekend, the Russians and their troll farms, their Internet folks, start hashtagging out 'take a knee' and also hashtagging out 'boycott the NFL,' "" Lankford said at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday.

""They were taking both sides of the argument this past weekend and pushing them out from their troll farms as much as they could to just raise the noise level in America and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they're trying to push divisiveness in the country,"" he said.

That's the very same modus operandi that Senate Intelligence Committee investigators and others have detected in Russian influence-mongers' use of Facebook last year.

Moscow's intelligence agencies not only used secret cyberattacks to steal and leak information, as the U.S. intelligence community concluded. The Russians also openly bought ads on Facebook aimed at amplifying the most controversial issues in American political life — including abortion, guns and LGBT issues — and used fake accounts to spread disinformation and even organize real-life rallies.

Facebook ads connected to Russian influence operations also supported Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders and Trump himself, Politico reported.

Facebook has denied it was aware that anything like this was taking place at the time. The company is turning over the content of about 3,000 Russian-linked ads to Congress and participating in the ongoing investigations into the election interference.

But Facebook has also acknowledged that as it investigates the way its network was used last year, it could find more examples of influence attacks.

Facebook's head of product policy and counterterrorism, Monika Bickert, said on Wednesday that the network's current practices offer a ""powerful tool"" for combating influence operations: requiring joiners to use their real names.

""That means that if you set up a Facebook account and you use 'Mickey Mouse' as your name, we will try to detect that and certainly, if it's reported to us, we will look to see if that's your real name,"" Bickert said at an event in Washington.

""We may ask you for identification. And if we determine that the account is fake, we will remove it. ... The ads that we've been talking about, the reason that we removed those was because they were coming from inauthentic accounts,"" she said.

The House and Senate Intelligence Committees both have convened hearings next month at which members are expected to ask representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google about the influence operations.

Twitter officials also are expected to meet with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators behind closed doors on Thursday. Staffers want to know about the use of the ""hashtagging"" that Lankford described, as well as the use of fake accounts, bots and trolls, to influence the trends and topics on Twitter.

This strategy isn't new.

""Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,"" the U.S. intelligence report said.

But what is new, as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and other leaders have told Congress, is the intensity of the operations and their breadth across the Internet.

They're so broad, in fact, they're aimed across the West. Russian influence-mongers also targeted Germany's recent election with an attempt to boost the results of an alternative, anti-immigrant party.

In another example, NPR found a troubling pattern in Facebook comments that appeared in response to its own news stories about Germany, including the recent presidential elections and the country's influx of refugees.

Those postings drew immediate floods of angry comments about immigrants, Syrians and how they are ""ruining"" Germany. Many commenters returned to reply multiple times to the same threads, working the social network's system for elevating certain comments to the most visible positions.

""I will never visit Germany again,"" writes one commenter on a recent NPR post. ""Many of my friends don't want to go either. Hundreds of YouTube videos showing the violence.""

""Millions and millions of men from violent third world cultures which do not know democracy — well, this is not going to end well,"" the same commenters wrote in a long reply thread.

While it's not uncommon to see vigorous debate among NPR's followers, an NPR editor discovered that many of the posts came from suspicious accounts — ones that showed their users had no friends, no photos, no personal posts or the other normal characteristics. NPR reported the accounts to Facebook, whose administrators took down many of the comments.

NPR receives some financial support from Facebook to provide video content on the site. So, in fact, do nearly all other big news organizations in the United States.

Facebook reaches about 68 percent of U.S. adults and has become one of the single most important purveyors of information from news organizations — just some of the reasons why it has attracted so much attention in the aftermath of the election interference.

Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?

Former President Barack Obama thought the problem so serious he took aside Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year to prod him about how seriously to take the spread of disinformation, The Washington Post reported.

Obama's successor also appreciates the magnitude of the social network: Trump used his own favorite channel, Twitter, to pile on against Facebook on Wednesday by accusing it of being ""anti-Trump.""

The post may also have been a reference to accusations by conservatives that they felt Facebook was suppressing their viewpoints, a complaint Zuckerberg took seriously enough to host a delegation last year that included the commentator Glenn Beck.

Or it may have been an allusion to the power that Facebook, per Trump, imparts to news organizations he considers hostile, making the service itself just as much of a problem from his perspective.

Members of Congress, led by the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., have broached the idea of new requirements for Facebook. That could include restrictions on the sales of ads to foreigners or at least more disclosure about the purchasers.

Lankford, on Wednesday, didn't address those questions in detail — but he didn't appear confident that anything might change influence operations soon.

""We've continued to be able to see that,"" he said. ""We will see that again at our election time.""

"Editor's Note: The two girls charged in the attack have been named in some news reports, including an earlier version of this post. However, after careful consideration of the information's news value, NPR is no longer naming the girls because of their ages.

Creepypasta, a horror fantasy website that allegedly spurred two 12-year-old girls to carry out a near-fatal stabbing of a peer, has posted a disclaimer distancing itself from the crime.

The two girls have been charged in adult court with attempted first-degree murder after the stabbing of another 12-year-old girl in woods in Waukesha, Wis. The defendants each face 65 years in state prison if found guilty.

The name of the victim, who is recovering in the hospital from 19 stab wounds, has not been released.

According to USA Today, the accused girls told investigators ""that they needed to kill someone to show their devotion to a legendary Internet character known as the Slender Man, which they read about on Creepypasta. They said they had planned for several months to stab a 12-year-old friend this past weekend, then walk to Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin, where they believed the character lived in a mansion, according to court documents.""

Creepypasta on Tuesday posted a response to the stabbing, saying: ""This is an isolated incident, and does not represent or attribute the Creepypasta community as a whole. This wiki does not endorse or advocate for the killing, worship, and otherwise replication of rituals of fictional works. There is a line between fiction and reality, and it is up to you to realize where the line is. We are a literature site, not a crazy satanic cult.""

According to the criminal complaint, one of the girls told investigators: ""Many people do not believe Slender Man is real ... [We] wanted to prove the skeptics wrong.""

The Slender Man character is described by The Associated Press as ""a paranormal being who lurks near forests and who absorbs, kills or carries off victims. In some accounts, he targets children. He looks like a long-limbed, lean man in a black suit but has no face. In some accounts, he has tentacles protruding from his back.""

The attorney for one of the girls tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his client needs a mental health evaluation as soon as possible.

""I'm basing that on my years of experience interacting with thousands of clients,"" attorney Anthony Cotton said. ""I believe she has those needs.""

"Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, the president's eldest son and his former campaign chairman, are set to testify publicly next week before a committee probing Russia's attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.

In a statement issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Trump Jr. and Manafort are listed as witnesses scheduled to appear on Wednesday, July 26.

The two men are expected to be questioned about allegations of collusion with Russia to influence the election.

The committee's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he wanted Trump Jr. to testify after learning about revelations that the president's son had accepted a June 2016 meeting with a Russian attorney who he was told had ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary"" Clinton. Trump Jr. had earlier expressed his willingness to appear before the committee.

Manafort and the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner — who is not on the witness list for the panel's hearing Wednesday — were also present at the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others at Trump Tower in June of last year.

Since the meeting was first reported by the New York Times earlier this month, the explanation of what took place there has evolved, with Trump Jr. and the White House downplaying its significance. However, emails later released by Trump Jr. show that he was told Veselnitskaya would provide damaging information on Clinton as part of ""Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

But Veselnitskaya has told NBC News that she never had any damaging information on Hillary Clinton and never had any intention of providing any at the meeting. Trump Jr. said in a statement to the New York Times that at the meeting ""it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information"" and that ""that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext"" because Veselnitskaya changed the subject to Russian adoptions and the Magnitsky Act. Speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity recently, Trump Jr. said, ""It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

"The practice of creating music specifically designed to ""succeed"" on streaming platforms and playlists swirled into a controversy for Spotify this past weekend, after an article written nearly one year ago was resurfaced in a story that mainly focused on how some people are financially ""gaming"" the Spotify system.

The allegation levied in that original story from Music Business Worldwide was that Spotify is filling out some of its more experiential, moody playlists (like ""Piano & Chill"") with bespoke music by artists that don't appear to, in practical terms, exist outside of the platform. Much was made of the possibility that Spotify could potentially license these songs-by-request at a lower cost than usual, reducing the enormous amount of money it pays out annually for music (the company paid some $2.48 billion last year to music rights holders, according to the most recently available financial filings). In a statement to Billboard, the company denied the practice, saying it ""never created 'fake' artists.""

Spotify has put a lot of focus on creating playlists it hopes people find both useful and easy. The company's most popular offerings range from genre-based lists like ""RapCaviar"" (which has 7.18 million subscribers), category-based lists like ""Today's Top Hits"" (16.32 million subscribers) and playlists that hew more to a mood, like ""Good Vibes"" (1.68 million subscribers) and ""Peaceful Piano"" (2.92 million subscribers). The company's acquisition of The Echo Nest, which at the time of writing had created 1.27 trillion data points — from tempo to demographic analyses — on 38 million songs, super-charged this strategy, giving it a broadsword of useful information with which to make its playlists ""stickier"" than ever before.

This relentless curation-through-playlisting is, in some ways, rewriting listeners' relationships to music, and artists' relationships to their fans. ""Thanks to this new way of presenting music, genre may be completely changing its identity, or even losing its meaning,"" pianist Neil Cowley wrote last year after one of his pieces benefited after being added to a particularly high-profile playlist. ""I can see how tempting it might be,"" he continued, ""for an artist to make music that fits a certain bill.""

""I'm trying to find an incentive for Spotify to create fictitious artists,"" Jeff Price, the founder of Audiam and someone who has had a spotty relationship with Spotify in the past (he was the indirect catalyst for a costly class action lawsuit the company recently settled), said. Reports ""suggest it saves or makes them money, but the only way that could happen would be if they own the recording and the composition — there's no way they're going to create an ancillary income by secretly hiring artists to create sound recordings they'll own so they can backchannel their royalties to themselves. For a company trying to go public, it isn't worth the risk.""

Nine artists with no profile whatsoever outside the confines of Spotify's green-and-black garden — Gabriel Parker, Charlie Key, Anna Olgica, Lo Mimieux, Greg Barley, Otto Wahl, Piotr Miteska, Karin Borg and Charles Bolt — did, as was reported, secure placement on some of Spotify's very popular playlists, like the aforementioned ""Piano & Chill."" These works, essentially credited to phantoms, are even inspiring real people to respond organically to some of this music. A person named Elysia Way, who found a song by Charlie Key ""through Spotify on a playlist,"" as she wrote, uploaded a video of her covering that artist's ""Song For A"" (which she renamed, for ""personal reasons""). Not for nothing, the supposedly fake Charles Bolt appears in a playlist embedded in Neil Cowley's article for The Guardian.

(It's also not unprecedented for artists to eschew the spotlight — like Daft Punk.)

""The big question mark is: What is Spotify's motivation?"" Tim Ingham, editor of Music Business Worldwide, wondered in a phone call to NPR from his home in the U.K. ""I do think, from the people who I've spoken to, that there's a motivation there to save some money, and to increasingly save money as the scale of streaming grows over time.

""I also find this question of artistic quality interesting. If Spotify truly believed in the science of a 'sleep' playlist, it kind of does make sense that you would ask someone to create something bespoke, based on data you've seen.""

Through The Echo Nest, Spotify has exactly that kind of data and, if true, isn't waiting around for ""legitimate"" artists to write the music they think they need.

Spotify's denial, stating that it never created ""fake"" artists, leaves open a neat, semantic loophole — what is the definition of a ""fake artist""? If there is a name and a song a person can play, is it fake? If that song is wholly generated by artificial intelligence, is it real? Several of these supposedly fake artists have been traced back to two very real Swedish producers — Andreas Romdhane and Josef Svedlund, as Music Business Worldwide found yesterday. There is a clear difference between their pseudonymous creations and myriad pop stars enlisting Swedish super-producer Max Martin to craft their art — his name is included in the liner notes, even if most listeners only pay attention to the name on the cover. But Svedlund and Romdhane have also assisted Kelly Clarkson with her work, too.

Spotify has in the past made a very big deal out of hiring at least one artist to create a customized piece of music for an extremely specific purpose. Two years ago, the electronic dance artist Tiesto created a song that would adapt its tempo to the running pace of the listener. ""This is where music is heading,"" Tiesto told Billboard at the time. ""Now the customer creates the mood, rather than the artist.""

A Spotify spokesperson explained to NPR that the artists cited as fake ""clearly do exist"" and that its playlisting team is ""programming an experience,"" flexing their expertise ""but also data, their understanding of fans, how people are using it. That's how a playlist is put together, a good playlist. It can't be all algorithm, or have it all be human — it has to be a human curator armed with data and tools.""

The question, really, reveals itself to be: What do these changes in listening, invisible or no, mean for the future of music appreciation? If it's taken as true that Spotify is paying artists to create works-for-hire in order to meet customer demand, how different is this from the practice of writing, or editing, songs to fit lengths more suitable for radio play? Neither is a pure expression of artistic vision, but decisions of commerce — of drawing in and retaining ears — and of demand. Most people welcome easy ways to fill their silence with sounds — ""the bulk of people are, at best, casual music fans,"" as leading Echo Nest scientist Paul Lamere put it. For many, the source of these sounds is less and less important. The ease of finding them, more and more so. Tiesto had a point.

Spotify appears to be readying for the future. Much as the Internet was once an anarchic, pixelated intellectual playground, it has since its inception become dominated by unfathomably powerful gatekeepers: Facebook and Google, primarily, but also Apple, YouTube and Netflix. They all have in common (at least) one thing — they're easy to use, requiring little of their users for those users to take advantage of them. Having 35 million songs on offer is truly remarkable, but the truth is that these playlists, and the shadow-artists that are helping populate them, are possibly serving a need.

This is probably not great news for fans of the expression-driven genius, right? But the line is blurrier and blurrier. Consider Brian Eno's most recent album, Reflection, an app which plays an endless swirl of velvet ambience that never exactly repeats. Eno put a lot of thought into this piece of work. The curators of the future are, maybe, doing the same.

As Eno explained in an interview around the release of Reflection: ""To make something is to express a belief in how things belong together.""

"Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference has passed the six-month mark, and President Trump's staff is painting a picture of a process nearing its end.

""We still expect this to conclude soon,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders has told reporters.

Ty Cobb, the outside attorney brought in to help the White House in its response to the probe, told NPR's Tamara Keith that Mueller's interviews with Trump campaign officials would be completed ""ideally by Thanksgiving.""

In a more recent interview with The Washington Post, he adjusted that estimate, but still said he ""remains optimistic that it will wrap up by the end of the year, if not shortly thereafter.""

Legal experts and others within the White House, however, are expecting a much longer slog.

""I was Ty Cobb's former law partner, and I think he's a good lawyer, but he's predicted this investigation is going to be over by the holidays, and I don't think there is any way, shape or form in which that's going to happen,"" said former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal.

He's a partner at Hogan Lovells, where Cobb worked before joining Trump's team.

""At the end of the day, we don't know a lot. But what we do know is that the investigation looks big and it encompasses a lot of people, and virtually every day there's a new Russian who is popping up connected to the Trump campaign,"" Katyal said.

Sam Buell, a law professor at Duke University, said he would be surprised if the investigation wrapped up before next November's midterm elections. He thinks the team of lawyers at the White House knows that, too.

""Those lawyers — they're quite experienced with federal investigations. They've been around this stuff, and they know how long it takes,"" he said.

In Washington, there is a political subtext to nearly everything, and Buell said that might be no different in terms of the way the White House has set expectations for how quickly Mueller's team works.

""One wonders whether it's designed to begin to sort of create a mounting pressure on Mueller next year, of people saying, 'Well what's he doing?' Why is he going on and on with this? Why are they spending all these resources without having produced anything yet?' "" he said.

Buell said it could play off the ""perhaps unrealistic"" public expectations that a massive investigation like Mueller's is perceived the same way the way as a homicide investigation, where ""you're just supposed to go to the crime scene and pick up the evidence and take it to court.""

""You could try to create that kind of narrative,"" he said.

Heading into the ""long winter"" in Washington, here's a look at some of Mueller's potential next high-profile targets, a few of whom are testifying before Congress this week, and the recent developments related to each:

 Michael Flynn

All signs suggest an inflection point could be coming soon for Flynn. Lawyers for the former national security adviser have cut off contact with President Trump's legal team — an indication that he could be cooperating with prosecutors or working toward a deal, a development first reported last week by The New York Times.

A number of interactions have come to light that have highlighted Flynn's vulnerability since he was fired by Trump in February. Most recently, it's a June 2015 trip to Egypt and Israel that congressional Democrats say he failed to disclose in applying to renew his security clearance. He's also failed to disclose payments from Russia-linked entities, and gotten into trouble for discussing sanctions with the former Russia ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Flynn also registered late under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which normally isn't a problem, but can become one if public reports contradict or show discrepancies in the forms he filed detailing his work on behalf of foreign entities.

 Erik Prince

Prince, the former head of the security contractor Blackwater, has come under scrutiny for a meeting earlier this year billed as ""an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump,"" as reported by The Washington Post.

Prince is scheduled to privately testify on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee about Russian election interference, although the transcript of the interview is expected to be shared afterward.

While he told the Washington Examiner in October that Mueller has not contacted him, what he tells congressional investigators is sure to be of interest in the special counsel's Russia probe.

Prince made large financial contributions in support of Trump and is the brother of Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, although he had no official role within the Trump campaign or transition team. According to The Post however, he presented himself as ""an unofficial envoy"" for Trump in setting up a meeting with a confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin around Jan. 11.

The Trump White House has denied knowing about any such meetings, and at the time, then-press secretary Sean Spicer said, ""Erik Prince had no role in the transition.""

 Jared Kushner

Kushner's responsibilities within the White House may be on the decline, but investigators' interest in the president's son-in-law and senior adviser continues to grow.

On Nov. 16, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice, sent Kushner's lawyer a letter complaining that his production of documents ""appears to have been incomplete.""

Specifically, the letter mentions ""emails concerning contacts with WikiLieaks and a Russian backdoor overture"" that Kushner did not disclose, despite the documents being ""known to exist,"" reported NPR's Scott Neuman.

A recent story in the New York Times says Kushner had been initially relieved when Mueller was appointed, assuming the special counsel's investigation would halt the parallel probes happening in Congress. That hasn't transpired.

""To some, that suggested he did not get it, that he did not fully grasp how the special counsel would scrutinize every single thing he had done in business, during the transition and during the campaign,"" wrote The Times' Sharon LaFraniere, Maggie Haberman, and Peter Baker.

 Jeff Sessions

Critics said the attorney general appeared to shift his story again in his most recent visit to Capitol Hill this month. Sessions says he has always answered all questions from Congress faithfully.

In his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Sessions said news reports helped him recall a March 2016 meeting with foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos at which Papadopoulos mentioned his contacts with Moscow and the offer of a meeting between Trump and Putin.

That seemed to contradict Sessions' earlier testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he said he was not aware of any Trump advisers or surrogates that were in communication with Russian officials. Sessions said news reports about the meeting jogged his memory.

In October, Sessions said he had not been interviewed by Mueller's team, but his narrative is sure to be of interest to the special counsel's team if he does end up giving testimony. Sessions is also scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence committee behind closed doors on Thursday.

 Donald Trump Jr.

The president's oldest son is at the center of a number of Russia-related interactions, most recently the revelation that he was in contact with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, at the same time the website was publishing damaging emails to the Democratic Party and nominee Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks acquired the stolen emails via Russian government cyberattacks, the U.S. intelligence community says.

Trump Jr. downplayed his messages with WikiLeaks, but the story continues to further the larger question of how much the Trump campaign knew about Russian interference efforts and whether any campaign officials did anything illegal to help those efforts along. The Senate Judiciary Committee's aforementioned letter to Kushner also seemed to allude to there being more communication between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks than just the Twitter messages Trump Jr. released.

Mueller is also said to be keenly focused on the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, among a few others.

 Paul Manafort/Rick Gates

Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, and his business partner, Gates, are facing charges, but that's far from the end of the story.

Outside legal experts say Mueller might hope to flip Manafort and work out a deal that lessens or eliminates prison time — he's facing the potential of 80 years in prison, according to the Associated Press — in exchange for information about other members of the campaign.

Manafort and Gates are currently on schedule to go to trial sometime next spring or summer.

"Updated March 16, 6:30 p.m. ET

The Republican and Democrat leading the Senate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election appeared Thursday to counter White House claims that there may have been surveillance of some sort on Trump Tower around the campaign, even if there was not specific wiretapping as President Trump said in a tweet nearly two weeks ago. Meanwhile, the White House aggressively defended the president's assertions on Thursday.

""Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,"" Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a joint statement.

The White House has asserted in recent days that when Trump tweeted that ""Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower,"" he was referring to various surveillance measures available to the U.S. government.

Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!

How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!

In a Fox News interview on Wednesday night, Trump said that ""wiretap covers a lot of different things."" He also said in the interview that he expects ""some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer reacted heatedly when asked about the statement from the intelligence committee on Thursday afternoon, accusing the media of covering the Russia investigation in a biased manner.

Spicer said the president ""stands by"" his claim, then went on to read off a number of media reports, many of which revolved around the investigation of possible Russian interference in the campaign but not necessarily surveillance of Trump Tower.

The response from Spicer lasted approximately nine minutes and involved the press secretary repeating the accusation of possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, which the intelligence committees have not said they have evidence to support.

Spicer also repeated an accusation from a report on Fox News, based on anonymous sources, that then-President Barack Obama used British intelligence to spy on Trump during the campaign.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said on Wednesday he doesn't believe ""there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,"" but the statement from the Senate intelligence leaders represents broader pushback.

Asked Thursday to weigh in on wiretapping, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""We've cleared that up. That — that we've seen no evidence of that.""

Trump has not produced any evidence to back his assertion. Spicer said this week, ""I think there is significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election."" And, referring to the president, ""I think he feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate him.""

The top Democrat on the House committee, Adam Schiff, told NPR's All Things Considered on Wednesday ""there's no evidence"" to support Trump's claim. Schiff says the question will remain: ""Why would the president do this? And that's a question the president will have to answer.""

Speaking at a Capitol Hill news conference on Wednesday, Nunes, a Republican from California, said:

""President Obama wouldn't physically go over and wiretap Trump Tower. So now you have to decide, as I mentioned to [the press] last week, are you going to take the tweets literally? And if you are then clearly the president was wrong. But if you're not going to take the tweets literally and there is a concern that the president has about other people, other surveillance activities looking at him and his associates — either appropriately or inappropriately — we want to find that out.""

FBI Director James Comey is likely to face questions about whether the agency obtained a warrant to wiretap Trump Tower at a House committee hearing on March 20. Nunes and Schiff confirmed NSA Director Mike Rogers will appear along with Comey at the hearing.

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, chairman of a Senate judiciary subcommittee investigating Russia, is also expecting some answers. In an interview on NBC's Today show, Graham threatened to subpoena the Department of Justice to force officials to reveal whether they have been investigating the Trump campaign.

Graham said the Senate will also hold up the nomination of Rod Rosenstein, Trump's pick for deputy attorney general, until Congress is provided with information ""to finally clear the air as to whether there was ever a warrant issued against the Trump campaign.""

Graham and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the subcommittee's ranking Democrat, sent a letter to Comey two weeks ago asking him to provide the information by Wednesday.

The former president's office has denied the charge. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said he knew of no warrant to wiretap Trump.

Graham says he knows of no evidence of such a warrant but added that he is now ""getting concerned, because it's taking so long to answer my letter."" The House Intelligence Committee had asked the Department of Justice to provide evidence backing up the president's claim by March 13. Nunes and Schiff now say they expect an answer by March 20.

Intelligence officials have concluded that Russia employed cyberattacks during the presidential campaign intended to hurt Hillary Clinton and aid Trump.

Nunes said it is possible that conversations Trump campaign officials had with Russia were captured in surveillance of Russian officials, such as contact between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Nunes expressed concern that such surveillance was leaked for political motivation and is asking for more information on such surveillance from the intelligence community.

"Last week in the Russia investigations: Mueller removes all doubt, the imbroglio apparently costs a man a government job and lots of talk — but no silver bullet — on digital interference.

How many more thunderbolts has Zeus in his quiver? Where might the next one strike? Who does the angry lightning-hurler have in his sights — and who will be spared?

Life is different now for denizens of the National Capital Region (aka Washington, D.C., to those who live beyond the Beltway). A car backfires on the street outside — is that more indictments? Three people show up for a reservation for four at BLT Steak — more charges?

Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller has removed all doubt that he intends to bring criminal charges in the Russia probe. On Monday, Oct. 30, the feds announced cases against three: Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman; Rick Gates, Manafort's business partner; and George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

Manafort and Gates are pleading not guilty; Papadopoulos pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators. Manafort and Gates surrendered to the FBI on Monday and were indicted; they returned to federal court in Washington on Thursday for a status conference about their bond and the conditions of their home confinement.

What no one can know but the parties involved is where this goes next. Among other things, Mueller has demonstrated that he can keep a tight lid: The FBI interviewed Papadopoulos in January and again in February. He was arrested in July. He finally reached his plea agreement last month — all without a word about it published by the media beforehand.

So daily life has become a bit stressful for people connected with the Russia imbroglio — all except for President Trump. He phoned The New York Times on Wednesday to make clear to correspondents Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker that he is perfectly calm. He bears no animus toward Mueller. He is utterly unconcerned.

""It has nothing to do with us,"" Trump said.

Not everyone is as sanguine as President Trump. The Papadopoulos revelations — that he had been approached by Russian agents from his earliest days on the campaign and that he passed along their offers to his bosses — set off a chain reaction in Washington.

For example, Papadopoulos says he aired at a staff meeting that he was getting overtures from Russians and mentioned at a staff meeting that Trump might meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some of them encouraged him. One of his superiors at the time, Trump campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, withdrew from consideration for a U.S. Department of Agriculture job rather than face his Senate confirmation hearing that had been scheduled for this week.

Clovis is understood to already have talked with Mueller's investigators and a grand jury in Washington.

And Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as Senate Democrats pointed out, has previously disclaimed multiple times in testimony before Congress any knowledge of any connections by anyone from the Trump campaign to Russian interference efforts. Judiciary Committee Democrats are making noises about wanting Sessions to come back and answer more questions in an open hearing, but Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, may not agree.

Clovis and Sessions have denied any wrongdoing or colluding with any foreigners during the election.

These second-order political effects from the Papadopoulos plea, however, help explain why the stakes are so high for potential Mueller targets. The DOJ investigation not only puts them in peril, but the people close to them, and the people close to them and so on.

Everyone's upset about Russia's use of social media to interfere in the U.S. election last year, but no one agrees on what to do about it. That was the upshot of a two-day, three-hearing marathon last week with Facebook, Twitter and Google. The Big Tech witnesses absorbed a lot of punishment and promised to do better — but mostly kept their powder dry.

A coterie of senators wants to mandate more disclosure and other restrictions in the way the tech giants handle political advertising. The companies say they're going to police themselves. In the back of everyone's mind is not only the need to prevent foreign influence campaigns, but also the precedent that would be set if Congress got into the business of trying to restrain Silicon Valley.

In terms of quick action, there appears to be nothing near-term in the cards. Even one of the sponsors of the online ads bill, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has said no action might take place until next year.

If no one can agree on how to prevent a future Russian cyber campaign, however, there was a great deal of new information about the last one. Quick example: Russia-linked content posted on Facebook during the last election cycle included art that showed Hillary Clinton, in red with devil horns, facing off against Jesus Christ. And Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., detailed how Russian influencemongers used fake accounts to organize a pro-Muslim and an anti-Muslim rally — for the same time and at the same place in the state of Texas — to try to create conflict. NPR's Miles Parks has that story.

Trio of House Republicans wants Mueller off the case

Three conservative lawmakers in the House are backing a resolution that would call for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller to get off the Russia matter. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and others call Mueller ""compromised"" over the role they say he played in the 2010 uranium deal that also implicates Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time it went forward.

Meaning what? The White House has gone back and forth about whether to play nice with Mueller or smash-mouth ball. The latest thinking, as you saw above, is that Trump is going to float overhead. But his allies want to tar Mueller and pull him into the alternate narrative about Russia and uranium that Trump used as an attack line against Clinton last year. At the same time, the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees also say they've opened new investigations into the uranium case, raising the prospect that they uncover more about it.

The issue with ""collusion""

Everybody's talking about ""collusion."" Here's the problem: that word, from a legal perspective, does not mean anything, as Ryan Goodman writes in a New York Times op-ed. Donald Trump's campaign last year met with Russians or their agents who had offered help to the candidate — dirt on Hillary Clinton, meetings with Russian leaders, etc. But the Trump camp says it didn't actually get any such dirt or convene any such meetings.

Meaning what? When the trip wire for improper or illegal action is ""collusion,"" but that means different things to different people, no wonder this imbroglio is so fraught.

Washington Post/ABC poll: Most Americans support Mueller probe

About 58 percent of Americans surveyed by The Washington Post and ABC said they approved of special counsel Mueller and his investigation, the news organizations reported on Thursday. Fewer than 4 in 10 in the poll said they thought Trump was cooperating with the DOJ probe.

Meaning what? But the impressions, as ever, largely depend on the partisan filter through which Americans now view events: Republicans were much less likely to approve of Mueller than independents or Democrats. ""[Seventy-eight] percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents [approve] of the way Mueller is handling the investigation, compared with 38 percent of Republicans,"" the Post reported.

"A former Trump campaign official has withdrawn from consideration for a job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture after being pulled into the imbroglio over Russia's interference efforts against the U.S. in the 2016 presidential race.

Sam Clovis said on Thursday that he would not go forward in trying to become the USDA's undersecretary for research, education and economics.

That news followed a quick series of connected developments in the Russia investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice special counsel: first, a guilty plea — announced Monday —by a former campaign adviser who worked for Clovis, and then, reports that Clovis has been interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team in the Russia case and also testified before a Washington, D.C., grand jury.

George Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser who has pleaded guilty, was approached by Russian agents early in his tenure and offered ""dirt"" on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and meetings with Russian officials. Papadopoulos aired those offers within the campaign and, according to court documents, received encouragement about building those relationships.

Questions have been raised about whether Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to keep meeting with or talking with Russians or whether Clovis did anything else to build ties between the campaign and foreigners trying to influence the U.S. election.

Clovis has denied any wrongdoing; his lawyer released a statement this week that said he ""vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump or staff. However, if a volunteer made suggestions on any foreign policy matter, Dr. Clovis, a polite gentleman from Iowa, would have expressed courtesy and appreciation.""

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration has ""respect for Mr. Clovis' decision to withdraw his nomination.""

There were indications that Clovis might have been in for a rough ride apart from the Russia matter. The post for which he was nominated is the Agriculture Department's chief scientist, but Clovis has no scientific background.

Clovis acknowledged that he didn't have standard scientific qualifications, The Washington Post reported Thursday, but he made a case to members of Congress that he had a practical knowledge of agriculture that would serve him in the job.

Democrats on the Senate agriculture committee, who would have been part of a confirmation hearing for Clovis scheduled for next week, said they would have pressed him both on his qualifications and his connections to the Russia imbroglio.

""His nomination was withdrawn because we learned on Monday that last year Mr. Clovis, while serving as the co-chairman for the national Trump campaign, gave the green light to George Papadopolous' attempts to collude with Russian operatives and obtain stolen emails from the Clinton campaign,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said on Thursday. ""Mr. Clovis' nomination was only withdrawn because that would certainly have been a topic during his upcoming testimony, under oath, before the Senate Agriculture Committee.""

"The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has been investigating Russian attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election. On Monday, the committee held an open hearing on the subject.

"Los Angeles is the only major American city where street vending is illegal, but that will soon change.

A campaign to legalize the city's sidewalk sellers, which has been in the works for years, is finally gaining strength from President Trump — or rather, from local resistance to his immigration policies.

In the city's Piñata District, southeast of downtown, tabletop shops offer everything from baby clothes to cellphone accessories to lunch. Estela Peralta flips tortillas on a hot plancha. She chops succulent carnitas and offers a variety of homemade salsas.

""Mira,"" Peralta says, pointing to a tub of guacamole and describing its ingredients. ""Avocado, tomato y chile.""

Her husband, Enrique, is known for making crispy pork skins. When he left Mexico for the United States, his father gave him one piece of advice: ""You should dedicate yourself to what you know — making chicharrón and making carnitas,"" he says in Spanish. ""A pig always has feet and a head. There you'll have no problem.""

The Peraltas do have one problem though — their little street food operation is illegal.

Selling on LA's sidewalks isn't allowed, even though 50,000 vendors do it openly. For years, vendors have had their wares confiscated, been ticketed, even charged with misdemeanor crimes. Peralta thinks the penalties are unfair.

""I don't know who decided that it's a crime,"" he says. ""Selling drugs in the streets, yes. But street vending, no.""

Many of LA's vendors are immigrants like the Peraltas. And for the ones who are in the U.S. unlawfully, contact with law enforcement can have especially serious consequences, like deportation.

City Councilman Jose Huizar represents the district where the Peraltas, and many other vendors, sell. He proposed legalization in 2014 but says he couldn't get political buy-in for it. In 2017, the politics look a bit different.

""Once Trump was elected and his anti-immigration, anti-Latino rhetoric was at the forefront of his campaign, council members around the city council decided to move forward,"" Huizar says.

Just weeks after Inauguration Day, the council began to develop a legal framework for vending and voted unanimously to decriminalize it immediately — to eliminate the chance that an infraction could lead to deportation.

""We didn't want to take a chance in further assisting with the division of families, should some of these individuals get caught up in the court system because of a small infraction,"" Huizar says.

Even neighborhood organizations and business coalitions that have long feared the spread of vending jumped on board with decriminalization.

In late March, the Los Angeles transit authority started pilot testing a vendor permitting system on its private property — the teeming outdoor Metro plaza near MacArthur Park.

As for the citywide permitting ordinance, there's sure to be more debate over the details — like which types of sellers can set up where, how many are allowed per block, and how heavily new regulations are enforced. The city's Office of the Chief Legislative Analyst is reviewing the policy and its report will likely be heard publicly this summer.

Not everyone's ready to throw the sidewalks wide open to vendors. Michael Zarabian, who owns a Mediterranean restaurant in downtown LA, says they undercut his business.

""You can't afford to sell the same sandwich for $4 with a drink. You're going to sell it for $10 to just survive,"" Zarabian says. ""They make it look cheap.""

According to Zarabian, brick and mortar businesses are held to higher standards and they're saddled with higher overhead costs. Zarabian quickly rattles off a list of his monthly expenses.

""A food cost of 35 percent [of menu price], utility bill, rent, a phone, cable, TV, fax, employment tax, quarter tax, all that stuff,"" he says.

But Clare Fox of the Los Angeles Food Policy Council says legalization will actually help to level the playing field.

""If we onboard street vendors into a formal economy, they'll be paying taxes, they'll be buying their business permits, and they are procuring their products from other suppliers,"" Fox says.

Fox helped to provide recommendations for the new vending ordinance. She says street vendors aren't trying to avoid regulation. They're asking for it.

""Street vendors want this,"" Fox says. ""They're the ones at the forefront of this campaign saying, 'Hey, we're in. We want to get a permit and play ball.' ""

That ability to play ball is exactly what Enrique Peralta craves for his family and business.

""Todos somos iguales,"" he says. Everyone's equal. The thought of not having the right to work upsets him.

""It's like if somebody cut your wings,"" he says. ""What would you do without wings? What would you do? Nothing.""

Peralta says he makes an honest living. And now, he wants to make a legal one. He attends a monthly gathering of street vendors who have been campaigning for the new ordinance, led by Carla de Paz of the East LA Community Corp.

""Compañeros!"" she opens, speaking in Spanish. ""Decriminalization. ... what does that mean?""

De Paz wants to be sure that the roughly 60 vendors in attendance understand what the movement has accomplished so far — and what it hasn't.

""We can't vend legally yet, but they won't arrest us anymore,"" she explains.

There's a sense of optimism in the room, but it's tempered with anticipation. De Paz worries that the city won't provide enough funding for outreach and education when the new permitting system is finally up and running, and that without it, vendors may not understand how to comply with new regulations.  

Sellers voice concerns that a proposed limit of just two vendors per block will threaten their bustling, informal street markets. They plan a citywide cleanup event to build goodwill in communities where they work in the highest concentrations. The meeting ends with a battle cry.

""Quando luchamas, ganamos!"" The vendors chant. When we fight, we win.

"On April 28, the magazine LensCulture posted a photo of what appeared to be a man raping a girl who looks like a young teenager.

The magazine — which has nearly a million Facebook followers — was using the photo to promote a competition in partnership with Magnum Photos, which cost $60 to enter 10 photos. ""Don't miss out!"" the post said, a few sentences above the photo.

The caption said the girl is 16 and is being forced to have sexual interactions with a ""client"" in the red-light district of Kolkata, called Sonagachi.

The girl is on her back, looking up at the camera, with a naked man on top of her. Her face is in full view. Her identity is not concealed.

Based on the content of the photo and its caption, the photo violated UNICEF's ethical guidelines on reporting on children by showing her face, which makes her identifiable, according to human rights activists.

The agency writes: ""Always change the name and obscure the visual identity of any child who is identified as a victim of sexual abuse or exploitation.""

The photo infuriated human rights activists and photojournalists.

""I've seen some moral bankruptcy in photojournalism, but this is the most extreme,"" says Benjamin Chesterton at Duckrabbit, a film production and training company, who first wrote about the photo. ""This is a photo of a child sex slave being used to promote a for-profit competition by Magnum — the most prestigious photo agency in the world.""

The incident also brings attention to a broader issue in photojournalism, Chesterton says: How the Western media depicts — and often demeans — young women and girls in poor countries.

""This is the elephant in the room: how we view the suffering of distant others,"" says human rights activist Robert Godden of Rights Exposure, which helps nonprofits and governments create effective and ethical campaigns. ""What if this photo series was taken in the U.S. or the U.K. — would the girl have been presented this way?""

He adds, ""Another good question to ask is: If this was a family member of mine, would I want them portrayed like this?""

Amid a barrage of protests from readers, photojournalists and human rights activists, LensCulture took down the photo hours after it was posted.

""But at this point, the magazine said nothing,"" Chesterton says. ""There was no statement, no acknowledgment of the absolute human rights abuse of that young woman, of that child.""

Two days after the image first went up, LensCulture issued an apology on Facebook for making a ""serious mistake in judgment"" in presenting the photo ""out of context.""

But the magazine defended the photo and its photographer, Souvid Datta:

We'd like to emphasize that we believe the work of the photographer was carried out with great ethical care and in close collaboration with the subject portrayed; by contrast, our own posting was hasty and presented the situation without proper context.

Datta did not respond to NPR's email request for an interview.

Within a few days of the controversy's start, the validity and ethics of some of Datta's other work came under fire.

Datta has been a highly regarded photojournalist since starting his career in 2013. He has won several prestigious awards, including ones from Getty Images and Magnum Photos. And his work has appeared in The New York Times and National Geographic.

On Thursday, Datta admitted to Time to doctoring images. The photo of the girl led to a closer look at Datta's other work, which led to accusations of plagiarism.

He admitted to taking a portion of a photo from influential photographer Mary Ellen Mark and inserting it into his own work without attributing it to her. He also admitted to taking other people's photographs and submitting them in photo competitions.

At that point, LensCulture changed its view. On Thursday, May 4, the magazine's CEO Kamran Mohsenin told NPR that they no longer believed the photo was ""taken with great ethical care.""

""Clearly that picture, in particular, is not appropriate in any context,"" Kamran says.

Shortly after LensCulture spoke with NPR, the magazine issued a new apology on Facebook:

""We condemn the lack of ethical standards used to create the photograph in question, and we apologize for publishing the photograph (which should never be published anywhere).""

Renowned photojournalist Donna Ferrato agrees that the photo is not appropriate in any context.

""There's no editorial value at all to this image. It's sensational, and it's incredibly damaging to the victim,"" says Ferrato, who did groundbreaking work documenting domestic violence in the U.S.

""When I first saw the photo used in the ad by LensCulture, I was really devastated,"" she says. ""It disgusted me that there are two men in the room with this young girl. There's the 'client,' paying to have sex with her. And behind the client, stands the photographer, who has been paid, through grant money, to take photographs of the girl being used.

""All this photo says is, 'We men are in power, and we can do anything we want. The photographer can do anything he wants,' "" Ferrato adds.

Last week, Datta, the photographer, posted a comment about the photo and the controversy to his Facebook page, which has been taken down.

In the statement, he said he was ""horrified"" that the photo was used to promote a competition. And the girl in the photo ""is now an adult and has given her consent to use her photo.""

Datta also defended the image of the girl:

She asked me to photograph this interaction — fully aware of my intention to publish this story widely in an attempt to create constructive awareness ... Where some see the image and point to the anonymity of the client and apparently undignified exposure of an underage girl, I see the astounding resilience of a young woman who takes ownership of her reality — unlawful, deplorable and bleak though it is — and determines to be more than what her circumstances have forced upon her. I see a woman who wants to speak directly to viewers, saying if you actually want to understand my perspective ""then look into my eyes and see what I feel.""

Human rights activist Godden doesn't agree with Datta's choice of showing the girl's face in the photo. He says that shocking photos such as this one aren't helping girls in Sonagachi, trapped as child sex slaves.

""Protection of children is always top priority,"" Godden says. ""If this photo was exposing a practice that was unknown or hidden, then you could possibly justify exposing a child's identity to document what's happening.""

Such an exception was made recently with child and adult slavery issues in the fishing industry in Southeast Asia and construction in the Middle East, Godden says.

Another example is Nick Ut's iconic war photo, showing a 9-year-old girl, naked, running away from a napalm attack in Vietnam. Historians credit that photo with changing the public's opinion about the war.

In the case of child slaves in Sonagachi, Godden says, the problem has been well known to activists and governmental officials for years.

""Human rights activists have been working on this issue for decades,"" he says. ""Awareness is not the problem, in my opinion. Now it's about technical support to these girls and countering corruption in those country. It's not about shocking photos.""

"Four months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in ""tatters"" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics.

It's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray.

On Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch.

Wray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, ""a witch hunt.""

Wray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself.

Both Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Does that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation, suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case?

Should there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him?

Look for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this.

""The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,"" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing.

""We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,"" Goodlatte added.

The job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was ""the Russia thing.""

For his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees, who have faced criticism from the president this year.

After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.

This week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to ""keep calm and tackle hard"" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. ""I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,"" he said at the time.

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year.

In a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities.

Courts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country.

The bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices.

The FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.

"The dust is starting to settle in Washington and around the country after an election that stunned political watchers and pollsters.

Here are seven things we've learned about Donald Trump's path to victory Tuesday night:

As vote continues to be counted, Hillary Clinton has now surpassed Al Gore's 2000 popular vote margin. Clinton's popular-vote lead is 668,171 over President-elect Donald Trump, according to the latest totals compiled by the U.S. Election Atlas. Gore got 547,398 more votes than George W. Bush in 2000.

Clinton's lead will only likely grow as votes continue to be finalized. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, but lost the Electoral College in two of them. This takes place as Democrats continue to migrate to cities and the coasts and where their population is now more concentrated.

The constitution mandates the Electoral College picks presidents. The founders created that system in part to avoid the largest states picking ""favorite sons"" and having outsize influence.

Turnout may even surpass 2012 when all the vote is counted. These figures represent only about half of all eligible voters in the U.S. But, as explained below, Clinton earned a lower share than Obama and more voters chose third-party candidates.

The number of people electing not to vote for the Republican or Democratic nominee went up by 4.5 million votes, nearly tripling from 2012.

It's difficult to say precisely which of the two major-party candidates these voters would have leaned towards. Libertarian Gary Johnson got more than 4 million votes (or 3 percent), up from 1.3 million in 2012. Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1.3 million votes in this election, only about 1 percent overall.

But more young voters went third party this year:

18-29 YEAR OLDS WHO CHOSE THIRD PARTY/OTHER2012: 3 percent2016: 8 percent

Clinton got nearly 5 million fewer votes overall than Obama:

Trump, meanwhile, got roughly the same number of voters as Mitt Romney four years ago:

18-29-YEAR-OLDSYoung voters were the same share of the electorate (19 percent), but went in smaller margins for Clinton than Obama and they jumped in third-party support from 3 percent to 8 percent:

2012: 60-37 Obama, 3 percent third party2016: 55-37 Clinton, 8 percent third party

LATINOSBy their sheer size, Latinos went up as a share of the electorate from 10 percent to 11 percent, but the idea that they would turn out for Clinton in bigger numbers than for Obama because of Trump turned out just not be true overall — and a significant share, especially among Latinos, went third-party:

2012: 71-27 Obama2016: 65-29 Clinton; 6 percent third party

Latinos certainly had an impact in the Southwest, helping Clinton win Nevada and Colorado and even made Arizona and Texas closer than past years. Texas was within 10 points for the first time in 20 years, and Latinos were a quarter of the electorate (24 percent).

It might be becoming clear that about 3 in 10 Latinos are simply part of the conservative base.

BLACK VOTERSBlack voters were down as a share of the electorate slightly and went for Clinton in a smaller margin — more like 2004 numbers for John Kerry:

2012: 13% of electorate, 93-6 Obama2016: 12% of electorate, 88-8 Clinton

In places like Wayne County, Mich., home to Detroit, and Milwaukee, Wis., Clinton was significantly off from Obama's vote total in 2012. In fact, had she met Obama's vote total, it would have made been more than enough to make up the statewide differences in both states:

WISCONSIN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +24,000 votesMILWAUKEE Obama total votes 2012: 332,000Clinton total votes 2016: 289,000 (-43,000)

MICHIGAN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +13,000 votesWAYNE COUNTYObama total votes 2012: 595,000Clinton total votes 2016: 517,000 (-78,000)

A similar pattern wouldn't have helped Clinton win Pennsylvania. She turned out about 25,000 fewer voters in Philadelphia than Obama, but that discrepancy would not have made up for the crumbling in rural areas and even some counties Obama won. Luzerne (Wilkes-Barre), for example, shifted huge to Trump — by 25 points. Erie shifted 18 points.

In North Carolina, despite Clinton doing better in the Research Triangle area than Obama, black voters, who traditionally turn out at high rates in North Carolina, dropped significantly:

BLACK VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA2012: 23% of electorate, 96-4 for Obama2016: 20% of electorate, 90-8 for Clinton

Could they have made up the difference? Quite possibly. Trump won the state by 177,000 votes out of about 4.7 million votes. If black voters were the same share of the electorate as 2012, and Clinton won 90 percent, she would have picked up some 126,000 votes. Now, if they voted in the 96-percent, same margin as they did for Obama and turned out at the same share of the electorate, Clinton would have picked up 191,000 votes.

Now almost no one expected, including the Clinton campaign, to get the same margins and share of the electorate with black voters as Obama, so these calculations probably aren't fair. What's more, Trump increased turnout among Republicans, so the black share would have to drop even if the same raw number turned out as 2016.

Sure, mathematically, no slippage with black voters, no third-party bleed among young voters in particular and juicing the Latino vote would have meant Clinton could have won despite a white, working-class cratering (more on that below). But that's not realistic, considering the election didn't take place in a vacuum. The declines are interrelated.

POST GRADUATESPost-graduates went by a slightly wider margin for Clinton than Obama:

2012: 18% of electorate, 55-42 Obama2016: 18% of electorate, 58-37 Clinton

This furthers the distinct education gap in this election, especially among whites.

They were a group Democrats used to compete with. In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton won them by a point. But they have fled to the GOP in the years since –- and now the gap between whites with college degrees and without appears to be the widest ever. A whopping 35 points.

NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben charted it here.

WHITES WITHOUT A DEGREE2016: R+392012: R+262008: R+182004: R+232000: R+171996: D+11992: D+1

Ohio and Iowa went by huge margins for Trump –- almost 10 points in Iowa and 9 in Ohio. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (by less than a point), leads in Michigan (by an even smaller margin), and lost by less than 2 points in Minnesota.

Those last three states went for Democrats in six straight presidential elections. They were crucial to the Democratic Blue Wall, and Trump took a sledgehammer to it.

We heard the voices of Obama-Trump white, working class voters in our stories online and on the air, but they never registered in big enough numbers — in public or private, non-partisan, Republican or Democratic polling before the election to show that a Trump win was apparent. Take a look at the vote shifts among the white, working class in some key states:

THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE IN INDUSTRIAL NORTH

MINNESOTA2012: 53% of electorate, 52-46 Obama2016: 44% of electorate, 55-38 Trump (net gain: R+23)

WISCONSIN2012: 58% of electorate, 51-47 Obama2016: 55% of electorate, 56-40 Trump (net gain: R+20)

IOWA2012: 57% of electorate, 52-46 Obama2016: 57% of electorate, 54-40 Trump (net gain: R+20)

MICHIGAN2012: 54% of electorate, 56-43 Obama2016: 58% of electorate, 49-45 Trump (net gain: R+17)

OHIO2012: 60% of electorate, 53-46 Obama2016: 56% of electorate, 51-45 Trump (net gain: R+13)

PENNSYLVANIA2012: 52% of electorate, 57-42 Obama2016: 52% of electorate, 52-45 Trump (net gain: R+12)

Overall, the reason Trump won was because he flipped big margins with white, working class voters in the Midwest and Pennsylvania — something that was always a possibility.

Trump spoke to these voters — whether it was on policy with how he blew up the Republican message on trade and Clinton's ties to the establishment and pro-globalist agenda; or his fueling white resentments and racial bias; and there was likely some degree of sexism that played a role. That's something that's difficult to measure, though there will likely be dissertations written about it.

But Clinton made her mistakes with this group — calling half of Trump supporters ""deplorables"" likely fired up these exact kinds of voters, for example.

The late-in-the-campaign letter from FBI Director James Comey about Clinton's emails likely also played a role, reinforcing a narrative about her as untrustworthy especially with voters who were prone to believe the worst about her.

In the end, though, Clinton allowed the caricature created of her to become cemented. It's actually surprising considering how she campaigned for her 2000 Senate seat. Back then, she took on the caricatures of her as a carpetbagger who didn't deserve it by meeting and talking with voters in upstate New York. Some questioned that strategy given New York City and the suburbs have such big populations and generally determine the outcome of statewide races. (Sound familiar?)

Clinton, though, worked hard and won many of them over — and easily won the Senate seat.

She never did that this time. It was something she promised she would do at the outset of this campaign, but it was never attempted during the general election when she was against Trump. Instead, she was largely absent from the campaign trail for most of August, staying out of the news, as Trump was steeped in controversy. That turned out to be a mistake.

She never created an affirmative message about her candidacy. ""Stronger Together"" was reactive to Trump. And she took for granted what used to be a critical piece of the Democratic coalition. It's ironic that instead of courting these voters to solidify the Blue Wall, she spent a lot of time courting Republicans. But the Republicans who would be open to her message would be metropolitan globalists, and it's the very type of message that appeals to them that would turn off populist, blue-collar Democrats.

A rural Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin tour might not have reversed this 36-year trend away from Democrats, but given how extraordinarily close all three states turned out to be, Clinton likely would have reduced the margins enough to win.

Of course, that's not what happened.

"Roger Stone, the longtime ally of President Trump's known for his brash and braggadocio style, answered questions behind closed doors from lawmakers and staff for the House Intelligence Committee for more than three hours Tuesday, as part of the panel's ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

In his opening statement, which was reported in the press prior to his appearance, and in speaking to reporters after his interview, Stone took issue with an investigation he called an ""entirely political exercise.""

""I expressed my view that I am aware of no evidence whatsoever of collusion by the Russian state or anyone in the Trump campaign,"" Stone told reporters.

Stone is of great interest to investigators because of things he has said.

Last year, it appeared that he may have known about stolen Clinton campaign emails before they were leaked, saying Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta would ""have his time in the barrel,"" two days before Podesta's emails were released.

And Stone has also been open about communications with a Web persona, Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russian cyberattackers who the intelligence community believes were behind last year's hack of the Democratic National Committee. Stone attached his Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0 to his opening statement to the committee.

Stone said Tuesday's line of questioning focused mostly on these interactions.

""While some may label me a dirty trickster, the members of this Committee could not point to any tactic that is outside the accepted norms of what political strategists and consultants do today,"" Stone said in his opening statement. ""I do not engage in any illegal activities on behalf of my clients or the causes in which I support.

""There is one 'trick' that is not in my bag and that is treason.""

After his interview, Stone said he answered all of the committee's questions but refused to identify a journalist who acted as an intermediary between him and WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange.

The committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Stone could be subpoenaed to return to answer questions related to that interaction.

""Hopefully, he will cooperate in the future,"" Schiff said, according to Reuters. ""If not, it will be necessary to subpoena him to bring him back to answer those important questions.""

Stone said he has not yet been contacted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Justice Department's Russia investigation. And he added that he had spoken to President Trump ""recently"" but not about Tuesday's appearance or ""this investigation.""

""I can assure each of you, I will not let myself be a punching bag for people with ill intentions or political motives,"" Stone said in his statement. ""Understand, I will expose the truth in every forum and on every platform available to me.""

"Updated on June 10 at 7:32 p.m. ET

So now that former FBI Director James Comey has appeared before a Senate committee and accused the White House of lying about his firing — and, in the process, raised significant questions about obstruction of justice — what happens next?

A lot.

In a surprise announcement Saturday evening, Attorney General Jeff Sessions bowed out of planned hearings about the Justice Department's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal set for June 13 on Capitol Hill, sending Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his place.

Instead, Sessions said in letters to lawmakers, he will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey's recent testimony ... it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,"" Sessions wrote, pointing to the committee's ongoing Russia investigation and access to information.

While Sessions' testimony Tuesday has the makings of another high-profile event, much of the next phase of the various investigations will likely not be as clear-cut and straightforward as the drama of congressional hearings carried live with millions watching on television and online.

The Senate and House Intelligence Committees will continue to sift through raw intelligence materials, and interview witnesses, behind closed doors in secure rooms. And special counsel Robert Mueller's team will conduct a criminal investigation that, based on Mueller's reputation, likely won't produce many leaked tidbits or updates to the outside world.

Here's what we do know will happen next with the multiple investigations digging into what Russia did to influence the 2016 presidential election, and into whether any Trump campaign associates collaborated with those efforts.

The Senate Intelligence Committee

After Comey's hearing Thursday, Committee Chair Richard Burr, R-N.C., said that at some point in the coming days, he and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., will meet with Mueller's team to discuss how the Senate can continue its investigation without interfering with Mueller's separate criminal probe.

The general concern is that the Senate committee could potentially make the special counsel investigation more difficult, by requesting evidence or interviews from people who may be key witnesses for Mueller.

Grants of immunity — a key part of both criminal and congressional investigations — are a key area where coordination would be needed.

In the immediate aftermath of Mueller's appointment, several key Senate Republicans, like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas, suggested the House and Senate Intelligence Committees may need to slow down their efforts, in order to stay out of the special counsel's way.

Burr asked Comey about that Thursday. ""Is there any doubt in your mind that this committee can carry out its oversight role,"" he asked, ""in parallel with the — now — special counsel that's been set up?""

""No — no doubt,"" Comey responded. ""It can be done. It requires lots of conversations, but Bob Mueller is one of this country's great, great pros. And I'm sure you all will be able to work it out with him to run it in parallel.""

The Senate committee recently received documents from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, in response to a subpoena. All along, Burr and Warner have said they plan to meet with Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law.

Several media reports indicate that conversation could happen in the coming weeks.

Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman to turn over his copies of Comey's memos about his meetings with President Trump. During his Thursday testimony, Comey told lawmakers he provided the documents to Richman, and instructed his friend to share the memos' details with the New York Times.

In the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton asked Comey if he would encourage Richman and the Department of Justice to share the memos: ""Sure.""

And Friday evening, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, recommended that the committee investigate ""all matters relating to obstruction of justice and use its subpoena authority if necessary,"" after testimony in the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier in the week from Comey and four other current intelligence chiefs.

The House Intelligence Committee

The House investigation is facing the same ""deconfliction"" challenges its Senate counterpart is, when it comes to making sure to stay out of Mueller's way.

The committee has issued subpoenas for ""testimony, personal documents, and business records"" to both Flynn and Michael Cohen, one of Trump's personal attorneys. Additionally, the committee has subpoenaed former Obama administration officials John Brennan, Susan Rice, and Samantha Power, in relation to the question of whether intelligence information was improperly shared or distributed for political purposes.

And on Friday, the committee sent a letter to Comey requesting any notes or memoranda ""memorializing discussions Comey had with President Trump.""

The committee sent a second letter to White House Counsel Don McGahn, requesting, as a press release put it, ""he inform the committee whether any White House recordings or memoranda of Comey's conversations with President Trump now exist or have in the past."" Of course, this is a reference to Trump's tweet warning Comey that there may be ""tapes"" of their conversations. If there are tapes, the committee asked McGahn to turn them over by June 23.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will also likely testify before the committee, though a date has not been set yet. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said the goal would be to hear from Johnson about what sort of warnings about potential Russian cyberattacks the Department issued to state election officials in the run-up to Election Day.

The Department of Justice special counsel

We don't know too much about where Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation stands. And based on Mueller's reputation for keeping developments out of the headlines, we don't expect to anytime soon.

Comey did tell the Senate Intelligence Committee that he handed his memos about meetings with Trump over to Mueller's office. He also indicated multiple times that he believed that as part of his probe, Mueller is investigating whether or not any obstruction of justice took place after the initial federal investigation into Russia meddling began.

One thing we do know about the Mueller investigation is the lawyers he has brought onto the team. When Mueller initially took over the FBI's investigation, he enlisted the help of prosecutors with deep experience investigating corporate fraud, Watergate and the mafia, among other matters.

According to the National Law Journal, Mueller has now added another high-profile lawyer to his team: Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who's one of the most respected lawyers within the Department of Justice.

The Trump wild card

On Thursday, Comey told lawmakers that he decided to tip the media off about Trump's ""let this go"" comment only after Trump tweeted about the possibility of a recording device inside the Oval Office.

Comey's move was just the latest significant develop in the Russia investigation to spring directly from unilateral, unprompted actions by President Trump.

Trump has repeatedly raised the profile — and the stakes — of the congressional and criminal investigations through his actions. The most significant example of this was his decision to fire Comey.

Other key moments include the ""tapes"" tweet, and a tweet accusing President Obama of ordering an illegal wiretap of Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. That's an accusation that the House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey, and other officials all say was made without any factual basis.

Trump's personal lawyer in relation to the Russia probes, Marc Kasowitz, has indicated he'll file complaints with both the Department of Justice and the Senate Judiciary Committee related to Comey's decision to feed information about his Trump memos to the New York Times via an intermediary.

Trump has repeatedly threatened legal action over the course of his political career, and often failed to follow through on those threats. But if Kasowitz does, in fact, file those complaints, that could be the next key development in this saga.

"The elephant in the room whenever talking about President Trump and the Russia investigation is the big I-word — impeachment.

The word had been in the not-so-far reaches of liberal conspiracy talk since Trump was elected. There is a website with more than 976,000 signatures on a petition encouraging Congress to impeach Trump. There is even an ""Impeach Donald Trump"" Twitter handle.

It is highly unlikely — there's almost zero chance — Trump would be impeached by a Republican Congress.

But with the revelation that James Comey, who was fired as FBI director last week, penned a memo after a Valentine's Day meeting with Trump in which Comey associates say Trump asked him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, the I-word is creeping its way into the mainstream.

Asked on CNN by Wolf Blitzer after the news broke Tuesday evening whether Trump could face impeachment, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said, ""Reluctantly, Wolf, I have to say 'yes' simply because obstruction of justice is such a serious offense.""

He later walked back that statement during a conference call with Maine reporters. ""You're jumping way forward,"" King said of the possibility of impeachment. ""What we really need to do is get the facts of this situation.""

He added, ""Before we start talking about obstruction of justice or impeachment, we need to get to the underlying facts.""

The number of Democrats starting to use the I-word is growing.

After Comey was fired, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said, ""It may well produce impeachment proceedings.""

""We're actually pretty close to considering impeachment,"" said Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth.

""He has committed an impeachable act and must be charged,"" said Rep. Al Green of Texas.

""We don't have to be afraid to use the word impeachment,"" Rep. Maxine Waters of California said Tuesday at a conference of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress in Washington. ""We don't have to think impeachment is out of our reach.""

Former top Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted an hour after The New York Times broke the story of the Comey memo that he had been ""resistant to impeachment talk until now.""

I've been resistant to impeachment talk until now, but if Comey memo is true-and Comey is very credible-we are into a whole new deal here.

If @POTUS told Comey 2 ""close down"" the Flynn investigation, as Comey memo alleges, it may well lead to the closing down of his presidency.

The White House understands the gravity of what The Times reported and NPR has confirmed — that in a closed-door meeting, the president allegedly told Comey he thinks Flynn is a good guy and said, ""I hope you can let this go.""

The White House is flatly denying that Trump did this.

""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that Gen. Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving Gen. Flynn,"" according to a White House statement. ""The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.""

The statement also noted, accurately, that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe ""said in his testimony last week that the WH had not interfered with any investigation.""

This White House has tried to spin its way out of a lot — from the president's inauguration crowd size to whether the president leaked classified information to the Russians.

But this flat denial is drawing a bright line in the sand. The White House understands that this is very serious and, if true, could have huge consequences for the Trump presidency.

So there are still a ton of questions to be asked. The White House press briefing has already become must-see TV and will continue to be, but the questions with teeth need to come from Congress. And a lot has to happen — and a lot of facts gathered — before anyone starts down the road to impeachment:

1. The memo has to be produced. Right now, many Republicans are doubting the veracity of the story. Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican in charge of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday shortly after The Times story came out that ""the burden is on The New York Times"" to produce the memo. Will he still feel that way in the light of day, especially given that House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz issued a subpoena to the FBI to turn over any Comey memos related to the investigation in one week?

2. Comey has to testify on the record and in public about the memo and the meeting. Even if the memo is produced, Comey will likely be brought before Congress to testify about the encounter. He should be expected to talk about it with the same vivid detail he did 10 years ago Tuesday — interestingly — about the night in March 2004 when he, as deputy attorney general, went to the hospital bed of then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to prevent White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card from pressuring Ashcroft to reauthorize the Bush administration's domestic surveillance program.

3. There have to be many Republicans willing to go along. Even if Comey testified, he would have to produce damning evidence that would convince Republicans that Trump had obstructed justice and should no longer serve. Grounds for impeachment are ambiguous. Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution reads:

""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

Impeaching a president takes a majority in the House and two-thirds of the Senate, and Republicans currently control both chambers.

4. Is this obstruction of justice? The first article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached, reads (emphasis ours):

""In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.""

But there is a question, even if the Comey memo is proved to be true, of whether Trump's alleged actions meet the legal definition of obstruction of justice. Some legal analysts and professors say yes — ""When someone at the White House is telling someone at DOJ or the FBI to soft-pedal or abandon an investigation, that's when people start talking about obstruction,"" University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck told Politico.

Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says maybe not. ""If it was a polite request saying, 'Oh, you know, he's a good guy, Flynn, I wish you'd back off this thing,' that's not an obstruction of justice,"" Dershowitz contended on MSNBC on Tuesday. ""If it was a command, it would raise stronger problems.""

He continued, ""I just think it's a very, very high bar to get over obstruction of justice for a president who, in fact, is the head of the unitary executive branch that includes the FBI and the Justice Department.""

Impeachment as political weapon

To be clear, ""impeachment"" has been used as a political weapon by angry opponents — some with better cases than others — for a long time. As Frank James wrote for NPR in 2013:

""[N]ame a modern, non-impeached president and someone probably imagined him being impeached.

""A Republican congressman from Michigan wanted Franklin Roosevelt impeached, and he wasn't alone. Perhaps more fancifully, the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote a poem titled 'Tentative Description of a Dinner Given To Promote the Impeachment of President Eisenhower.' Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, especially, all inspired more or less serious calls for their impeachment.""

Since President Bill Clinton's impeachment by the House (not confirmed by the Senate) and the advent of the Internet, the political rhetoric using the I-word has seemed to ramp up.

Plenty on the left were calling for the impeachment of George W. Bush as the Iraq War was spiraling out of control and over the revelation that that country had no weapons of mass destruction, despite claims of evidence by the U.S. There were ""Impeach Bush"" bumper stickers in lots of different forms. (You can still buy some for $4.99 on Cafe Press.)

The calls even came from a New York businessman, who flirted with his own runs for president.

""I was surprised that [then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi] didn't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush. It was almost — it just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing.""

That happened to be Donald J. Trump on CNN with Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer followed up, ""Impeaching him?""

""Absolutely, for the war, for the war,"" Trump responded.

""Because of the conduct of the war,"" Blitzer said.

""Well, he lied,"" Trump responded. ""He got us into the war with lies. And, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true.""

That was 2008. Times and opinions change.

The calls on the right for Obama's impeachment were loud as well. There was an Impeach Obama website that had more than double the petition signers than the Trump one. It urged people to call Congress, gave the Capitol switchboard number and instructed them to ""in plain — but polite — language, demand impeachment and give a reason or two why.""

Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes even admitted to Michael Crowley in Politico magazine in January that part of why Obama didn't act on Syria unilaterally — without Congress' approval — was fear of impeachment.

""[W]e had no domestic legal basis. We actually had Congress warning us against taking action without congressional authorization, which we interpreted as the president could face impeachment,"" Rhodes said, adding, ""That was a factor. Go back and read the letters from [then-House Speaker John] Boehner, letters from the Republican members of Congress. They laid down markers that this would not be constitutional. If we got drawn into a conflict in Syria without congressional authorization, without international authorization, without international support, you can see very clearly how that could have completely derailed this entire presidency.""

To reiterate, Trump is unlikely to be impeached by a Republican Congress.

But if things keep up at this pace — if the Comey memo comes out and he delivers damning testimony — and the GOP still does nothing, not even setting up an independent investigation, you can guarantee that the I-word would hang all over next year's midterm elections.

And, as much as in any election, Trump's presidency would be top of mind for voters.

"It's tempting to keep the computer running late and promise yourself an extra 30 minutes of bed rest in the morning. It's tempting to do it again the next night, too. But sleep inevitably loses out to getting up early for school or work.

There's a simple way to combat this: End all artificial lights at night for at least a weekend and drench your eyes in natural morning light, says Kenneth Wright, a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder and senior author on a study on resetting sleep cycles. The most straightforward way of doing this is to forbid any electronics on a camping trip.

In the study, published Thursday in Current Biology, Wright reports on the latest of a series of experiments where he sent people out camping in Colorado parks to reset their biological clocks. Small groups of people set out for a week during the summer, an experiment published in Current Biology in 2013.

This most recent study shows the results of camping a week in winter and once over a winter weekend. Others stayed at home to live their life. Along with sleep, Wright kept track of people's circadian rhythms by measuring their levels of the hormone melatonin, which regulates wakefulness and sleep.

Before each camping trip, Wright says that he noticed something odd about the study participants' melatonin levels.

In general, melatonin makes us feel tired. Levels of the hormone rise a couple of hours before we sleep, and they fall right when we wake up. ""In the modern environment, those melatonin levels fall back down a couple of hours after we wake up,"" Wright says. ""Our brains say we should be sleeping several hours after we wake up."" The participants' sleep and wake times were slightly out of step with their internal clocks, like constantly being a little jet lagged.

But after people got back from a week-long camping trip, the jet lag was gone.

""[Melatonin] would go down at sunrise and right when people woke up,"" Wright says. And people's entire sleep schedules had shifted earlier so that they were going to bed and rising two or more hours earlier than they had been before camping. Those who had gone camping for just a weekend had their sleep schedules shifted by a little less than an hour and a half.

Why this happens probably has to do with how drastically different an environment lit by light bulbs and laptops is from one of sun and starlight.

Outside, ""you are pretty constrained by natural light-dark cycles and the intensity and light spectrum that you see in nature,"" says Dr. Phyllis Zee, director for the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University who was not involved with the study. Natural light, particularly morning sunshine, which is enriched with blue light, has a very powerful influence on setting internal clocks.

That bright light can affect our circadian rhythm is nothing new, Zee says. But this collection of studies make very clear how an artificially lit environment at night can push our sleep timing further back, while bright, blue-rich light can train our circadian rhythms to sync earlier in a way that is actionable. Sleep doctors will often suggest that people use a light box indoors in the morning to simulate dawn, but's not always as effective as real dawn.

""I actually have used that [summer camping] study to treat some of my patients,"" Zee says. ""We see people who can't fall asleep until 4 am. It can be very difficult to use this light box in the morning and avoid light at night. So you say, okay, there's this camping thing.""

If camping is not your thing, Zee suggests trying to copy a natural light-dark cycle, at least on the weekend. ""Over 60 percent of the shift can happen over a weekend. It's pretty amazing,"" she says. ""We can on weekends or days off go out or sit by the window and just expose ourselves to a natural light-dark cycle.""

And in a perfect world, homes, schools and offices would have artificial light that could mimic the spectrum and the intensity of natural light. ""As a new design philosophy, think about light as important as having clean air,"" Zee says. ""It's possible. It's totally possible.""

President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey has reignited calls for some form of independent investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Comey confirmed in March that the FBI was looking into the matter (as are congressional committees).

But these calls come in various flavors.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wants a ""special prosecutor."" He warns via Twitter, ""If we don't get a special prosecutor, every American will rightfully suspect that the decision to fire #Comey was part of a cover-up.""

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California is calling for an ""independent prosecutor."" Feinstein says in a statement that she also supports the appointment of a ""special counsel"" by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona wants to see a ""special congressional committee."" That's not a new request from McCain, but he argues Comey's firing ""only confirms the need and urgency of such a committee.""

Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan says he's leaning toward an ""independent commission"" to investigate Russian meddling.

Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is pooh-poohing all of these suggestions. On the Senate floor Wednesday morning, McConnell warned that a new investigation ""could only serve to impede the current work being done"" by the FBI and the Senate Intelligence Committee.

A little history

The first ""special prosecutor"" was Archibald Cox, who was appointed by President Richard Nixon's attorney general in 1973 to investigate the Watergate scandal. Cox was later fired in October of that year, along with Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy, William Ruckelshaus. This was the notorious ""Saturday Night Massacre"" to which Comey's dismissal was immediately compared.

In the post-Watergate period, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, which formalized the procedures for appointing special prosecutors and also rebranded them as ""independent counsels."" Independent counsels were appointed by a three-judge panel at the request of the attorney general. Congress could also petition the attorney general to seek such an appointment, although the attorney general was not required to do so. The most famous independent counsel was Kenneth Starr, whose investigation ultimately led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The Ethics in Government Act expired in 1999 and was not renewed.

Since 1999, the attorney general has occasionally appointed ""special counsels"" to investigate suspected criminal activity when an investigation by the Justice Department itself might pose a conflict of interest. Because these counsels are appointed by — and answer to — the attorney general, they have less formal independence than independent counsels.

One famous special counsel was Patrick Fitzgerald, who investigated and prosecuted Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, for his role in the public identification of Valerie Plame, a covert CIA officer. (Libby was convicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges. His prison sentence was later commuted by President George W. Bush.) The attorney general at the time, John Ashcroft, had recused himself from the matter so Fitzgerald was appointed by Ashcroft's deputy ... James Comey.

Next steps

A special prosecutor or independent counsel could be appointed by Rosenstein (since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from all matters involving Russian ties to the 2016 elections), although such an investigator would probably go by the title ""special counsel."" Schumer said last month that he received assurances from Rosenstein that the deputy attorney general would appoint a special counsel ""if one is required.""

Alternatively, Congress could reauthorize something like the Ethics in Government Act, creating a new role for independent counsels. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is drafting legislation in that mold as a backup, in case the deputy attorney general fails to act.

Congress could also establish its own select committee of lawmakers to investigate, as McCain proposed.

Finally, lawmakers could appoint a special commission of outsiders to investigate, along the lines of the 9/11 Commission. This approach is favored by Amash.

"In November 2013, Donald Trump took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, bringing his trademark glitz and glamour to a country that had never hosted a major beauty contest.

Trump later boasted that he met a lot of important people at the pageant. They included the billionaire real estate tycoon Aras Agalarov, who is now figuring prominently in the investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Here is a look back at how the Miss Universe contest came together and what happened there.

2012British-born music promoter Rob Goldstone began representing singer Emin Agalarov, son of billionaire real estate investor Aras Agalarov. At the time, Emin was married to Leyla Aliyeva, the daughter of Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev.

March 21, 2013In a Facebook post from New York, Goldstone announced he would be attending the Miss USA pageant in June. He served as a preliminary round judge at the event.

May 31, 2013Emin Agalarov released a music video featuring 2012 Miss Universe Olivia Culpo. This collaboration led Golstone to meet with the head of the Miss Universe Organization, Paula Shugart, according to Mother Jones.

June 15, 2013""Fun meeting with Donald Trump,"" Rob Goldstone posted on Facebook.

June 16, 2013During the Miss USA pageant, Trump announced the location for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant: Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia. Trump was joined on stage by Aras Agalarov, president of Crocus Group, and his son. The elder Aras later told a Russian news outlet that Trump greeted him warmly, saying, ""'Look who came to me! This is the richest man in Russia!'""

Later in June, the Russian parliament passed a series of anti-gay laws. In an interview with Miss Universe co-host Thomas Roberts before the event in November, Trump defended his decision to keep the pageant in Moscow.

June 18, 2013Trump tweeted about the upcoming pageant. ""Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?"" he wrote.

November 9, 2013Miss Universe took place at Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia. Emin Agalarov performed at the event.

November 13, 2013In an interview with Forbes, Emin Agalarov said Crocus Group, ""may theoretically consider a possibility of building a Trump Tower as one of our skyscrapers.""

November 20, 2013Emin Agalarov released his music video for ""In Another Life."" The video features him at a dull business meeting, daydreaming about Miss Universe contestants. His fantasies are suddenly interrupted by the man running the meeting, Donald Trump, who barks, ""You're fired!"" The pop musician would later tweet about the video, after a controversial dossier was leaked making allegations about Trump's Russia visit.

February 4, 2014Ivanka Trump visited Crocus City Hall in Moscow. Emin Agalarov gave her a tour.

March 8, 2014Emin Agalarov performed at the 2014 WGC-Cadillac Championship golf tournament held at Trump National Doral near Miami, Fla.

September 21, 2015Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt about meeting Russian oligarchs during the Miss Universe pageant. He said, ""... two years ago, I was in Moscow. And a lot of the people, Hugh, they were there, and they had an amazing time. And they're terrific people. You know, I was getting along with them so great. I really loved my weekend, I called it my weekend in Moscow. But I was with the top level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.""

June 3, 2016Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., offering up incriminating information on Hillary Clinton. ""Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting,"" he wrote. Goldstone said the information came from the ""crown prosecutor,"" an apparent reference to Russia's top prosecutor, Yuri Chaika.

Throughout the campaign, Emin Agalarov and Goldstone supported Trump on social media. ""You proved the entire world wrong, it's just incredible!"" Emin Agalarov posted on November 10.

June 9, 2016Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and a Russian-American lobbyist met with Trump Jr., then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

July 24, 2016On CNN, Trump Jr. skewered the Democrats for accusing the Trump campaign of colluding with Russian hackers to release documents from the Democratic National Committee. ""I mean, I can't think of bigger lies — but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win,"" he said.

November 8, 2016Goldstone posted a picture of Emin Agalarov, himself and Trump captioned ""The A Team - headed to the White House!""

November 13, 2016Days after the election, Goldstone shared a picture of himself, Emin Agalarov and president-elect Trump that ran on Russian TV.

July 8, 2017The New York Times first reported the existence of the meeting with Trump Jr., Manafort, Kushner and Veselnitskaya.

July 11, 2017Trump Jr. published the email exchange with Goldstone on his personal Twitter account. Later in the day, White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reads a statement from the president: ""My son is a high-quality person, and I applaud his transparency.""

"There is one generation that has been consistently defined by its obsessions: avocado toast, memes, Harry Potter ... and self-care. They are often perceived as entitled snowflakes, but millennials might be the generation of emotional intelligence.

Self-care existed long before millennials did. Ancient Greeks saw it as a way to make people more honest citizens who were more likely to care for others. In her 1988 book, A Burst of Light, Audre Lorde wrote that ""caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation and that is an act of political warfare.""

Today, self-care, as it's defined by Gracy Obuchowicz, a facilitator and self-care mentor and coach in Washington, D.C., ""assumes that we're OK as we are and we just need to take care of ourselves ... Self-care alone is not enough. You need to have self-awareness too. Self-care plus self-awareness equals self-love.""

While self-care has been around for centuries, it has only recently been co-opted by stars such as Solange and consumerized into self-care kits.

In 2015, according to the Pew Research Center, more millennials reported making personal improvement commitments than any generation before them. They spend twice as much as boomers on self-care essentials such as workout regimens, diet plans, life coaching, therapy and apps to improve their personal well-being. They've even created self-care Twitter bots.

But why is there a generational divide in taking care of yourself?

One study showed that this might have all sprouted out of the Internet. It found that students reported using the Web to identify self-care strategies, alternative therapies and other information related to nutrition and fitness.

Do a quick Google search and you'll find hundreds of articles about self-care, occasionally accompanied with lists of advice such as ""go to a farmers market"" or ""buy a new candle"" or ""drive with the windows down."" So it comes as no surprise that the generation that takes advantage of the Internet the most is also the generation that devotes the most time and money to the $10 billion self-care industry.

Hyepin Im, the president and CEO of Korean Churches for Community Development and an expert on mental health and digital literacy, also found that the Internet was likely the cause.

""In a way of having that affordable free access to information increases awareness to these areas we didn't know from schooling or families,"" Im said. ""Once you're aware, these new tools and apps equip us ... to actually make that investment.""

Then again, Im points out, we might have created a solution for a problem of our own making.

""Increased awareness is very powerful,"" Im said. ""The other piece, in some ways we're constantly bombarded in self-absorption.""

Im said we might find ourselves comparing our lives to the perfection we see on the Internet, which leads us to utilizing online tools for self-care — and the cycle continues.

""There is this point where you do also have this time for self-reflection and you start seeking substance and meaning beyond a whole selfie. You start searching. Those are also things that push our generation,"" Im said.

Furthermore, Im said the introduction of social media throughout the millennial generation has increased understanding of mental illnesses and decreased the stigma.

""Maybe in the past, you thought someone was crazy or lazy, but now we've learned more,"" Im said. ""It's a continuum. A lot of those things [like increased Internet access] allow you to become more sensitive to others.""

Beyond social media, Obuchowicz said she has noticed an uptick in the interest in self-care lately, particularly since the election. It's true: Google searches for the term reached a five-year high after the election.

But Obuchowicz says it's more than just social media that has pushed millennials to the forefront of the self-care discussion.

""Our generation has seen enough,"" she said. ""People are really hungry for knowledge. It's a relatively new idea in our culture that we would be paying attention to how we feel and using that as a kind of intelligence. It's something that's really waking up in our culture and our generation.""

Obuchowicz said millennials look at their parents and grandparents and are grateful for what they've done but aren't willing to go about life in the same way.

And they are not the first generation to do so.

""What our mothers did in comparison to our grandmothers was epic,"" Obuchowicz said. ""This is our revolution.""

"Federal prosecutors have lots of ways to intensify pressure on the people they're investigating, from early morning FBI raids to leaning on relatives of those under government scrutiny.

But even by those measures, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in last year's presidential election is moving with unusual speed and assertiveness, according to half a dozen legal experts following the probe.

Consider disclosures that FBI agents executed a search warrant last month for business and tax records at the suburban Virginia home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. That step would have required them to prove to a judge that there's probable cause a crime has been committed.

Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel frequently criticized for alleged overreach by then-President Bill Clinton, never utilized search warrants, two members of the team told NPR. Neither did the special counsel investigating the leak of a CIA operative's identity in the George W. Bush administration, said William Jeffress, a Washington attorney who represented White House aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby in that probe.

""A search warrant in a case like this is highly unusual,"" Jeffress said.

Lawyers said the special counsel may have been motivated to use a search warrant over concerns that evidence might be concealed or destroyed, which sometimes happens in terrorism and drug trafficking cases. Or, they said, Mueller may have been moving quickly amid a series of existential threats. In recent weeks, President Trump has blasted the Russia investigation as a ""witch hunt"" and flirted with the idea of firing Justice Department leaders as a roundabout way to get rid of Mueller himself.

Talking with reporters Thursday, the president said he was ""very surprised"" by the FBI raid at Manafort's home and said it sent a ""strong signal."" Trump also said that the White House is cooperating with the special counsel probe even though, he said, the subjects under investigation never happened.

In any case, the Justice Department frequently deploys tough tactics with a larger goal in mind: securing the cooperation of insiders who can guide authorities through a complex investigation and help deliver bigger targets.

""I call it 'climbing the ladder,' "" Jeffress said. ""It happens in every corporate investigation,"" where investigators question clerks and assistants, and then move up to vice presidents and higher-level executives.

A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, said he is responding to government inquiries.

Whether Manafort, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn or anyone else decides to strike a deal with the government is being closely watched by people in and outside the probe.

Authorities routinely enlist relatives to try to turn up the heat. Recent media reports suggested that investigators have reached out to Manafort's son-in-law, with whom he'd entered into some real estate dealings.

Indeed, several members of Mueller's 16-lawyer special counsel team have a long history of approaching lower-level figures, including spouses and in-laws, to build bigger cases.

Take Andrew Weissmann, a special counsel lawyer who once led the Justice Department's Enron Task Force. Prosecutors looking to uncover and punish fraud at that defunct energy company famously threatened to charge the wife of the company's chief financial officer with tax offenses if he did not agree to plead guilty and testify against his corporate superiors. The finance official, Andrew Fastow, refused. So, authorities indicted his wife, Lea. They both served prison time.

A more recent addition to the special counsel team, Greg Andres, helped bring to justice the Bonanno crime family boss as a young mob prosecutor in Brooklyn, N.Y. Through the course of the trial, Andres helped unravel dozens of crimes over three decades, using federal agents and members of the crime family as narrators. One of his key witnesses was the brother-in-law of the defendant, Joseph Massino.

""The story principally was told from the vantage point of those involved in the crimes at issue and their credibility was a crucial issue,"" Andres told the publication Law360 last year.

Andres so got under the skin of the mobsters that one later testified he had been targeted for a ""hit.""

A pair of Russian state media organizations will no longer be able to advertise on Twitter, the company said Thursday — a direct result of their role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The announcement took place less than a week before much-anticipated hearings on Capitol Hill at which representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to be grilled by lawmakers about how Russia used their platforms as part of its influence campaign in the U.S.

Twitter's decision to suspend advertising by Russia Today, or RT, and the news agency Sputnik is ""effective immediately,"" the company announced in a statement.

""Early this year, the U.S. intelligence community named RT and Sputnik as implementing state-sponsored Russian efforts to interfere with and disrupt the 2016 presidential election, which is not something we want on Twitter,"" the company said.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred to RT and Sputnik specifically in a report in January as organizations that ""contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.""

Twitter pointed to that report in announcing the decision, as did California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in praising it.

""Twitter's decision should prevent these entities from pushing Russian propaganda in front of users who may not realize the manner in which Russia employs both RT and Sputnik to spread disinformation and undermine democracies around the world,"" Schiff said in a statement.

The Russian government, as well as RT, responded immediately.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state media that the move was a violation of international laws that ""guarantee the freedom of speech.""

She added that ""retaliatory measures will naturally follow,"" a message echoed by RT's editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan.

""I never thought that Twitter is under the control of the U.S. security services — it seemed like a conspiracy theory. But now Twitter appears to have admitted it,"" Simonyan said to another state media agency. ""This is highly regrettable. It is particularly regrettable that now U.S. media operating in Russia will feel the tender response of the Russian authorities.""

RT has also been involved in a back-and-forth with the Justice Department, over whether it should register its American arm under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. 

Doing so would require the company to disclose funding information and be more outwardly transparent about its relationship with the Russian government, but as CNN reports, despite a mid-October deadline request by the DOJ, there is no sign RT is planning on registering.

RT and Sputnik will be allowed to remain regular users of Twitter — in other words, to post with normal accounts — but they won't be allowed to pay to promote them.

Twitter added in its statement that the company would be donating the $1.9 million it is projected to have received from RT since 2011, to fund external research into the impact of Twitter on elections, with a focus on ""malicious"" automated bots.

The company also vowed this week that it would launch an ""industry-leading"" transparency site about who buys ads on its service and what messages are involved.

"Updated at 3:44 p.m. ET

The members of the Senate Intelligence Committee had one question they asked again and again Wednesday of the country's intelligence chiefs: Did President Trump want you to downplay investigations surrounding Russia?

And time and again, the intelligence officials declined to answer.

At the often contentious hearing, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, the committee's vice chairman, was the first to press the question. He asked the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, and the head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Mike Rogers, about media reports that Trump asked them to intervene in the Justice Department investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the broader inquiry surrounding Russia.

Both answered in broad terms.

""In the three-plus years I have been director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate,"" Rogers said. ""I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.""

Coats responded in a similar vein.

""In my time of service,"" Coats said, ""I have never been pressured, I've never felt pressure to intervene or interfere, in any way, with shaping intelligence in a political way.""

However, neither would discuss their conversations with Trump, and declined to say if he asked them to take any action regarding the investigations.

Warner, along with several other senators, kept pushing and ultimately expressed frustration with the intelligence chiefs.

There are ""reports, that nobody has laid to rest here, that the president of the United States has intervened directly in an ongoing FBI investigation and we've got no answers from any of you,"" Warner said.

The verbal sparring became so intense that Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, intervened at one point during a sharp exchange between California Democrat Kamala Harris and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

""The chair is going to exercise its right to allow the witnesses to answer the question, and committee is on notice to provide witnesses the courtesy, which has not been extended all the way across,"" Burr said.

Republican John McCain of Arizona took a softer approach, drawing chuckles when he asked Coats, ""Do you want to tell us any more about the Russian involvement in our election that we don't already know from reading The Washington Post?""

Coats did not offer any details, but said, ""Just because it's in The Washington Post doesn't mean it's declassified.""

The hearing brought four senior intelligence and law enforcement officials before the committee on Wednesday. In addition to Coats, Rogers and Rosenstein, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also testified.

The hearing was highly anticipated because stories about the Russia investigation have emerged piecemeal, often based on anonymous sources. The intelligence chiefs are all key figures in the investigation, but have rarely spoken publicly, and not in one place, at one time, and under oath.

However, the hearing offered relatively little new information, and shortly after it ended at midday, it was overtaken by the release of a statement by James Comey, the former FBI director who was fired by Trump on May 9.

Comey is scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday morning, and his prepared statement was posted on the committee's website. In the statement, Comey says Trump asked him for ""loyalty"" at a January dinner. Comey says the president also spoke to him about the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and said, ""I hope you can let this go.""

The president has repeatedly called for an end to the various inquires swirling around his administration. But Democratic senators, in particular, want to know what he's told intelligence officials in private discussions.

Trump reportedly asked Coats and Rogers to state publicly that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Neither official has done so.

Citing these reports, Warner said in his opening statement:

""If any of this is true, it would be an appalling and improper use of our intelligence professionals — an act that could erode the public's confidence in our intelligence institutions. The (intelligence community) fiercely prides itself on its apolitical service to the country. Any attempt by the White House or even the president himself to exploit this community as a tool for political purposes is deeply, deeply troubling.""

While Democrats have focused on possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, Republicans have focused on leaks about the investigation.

The president has frequently railed against leaks, and a government contractor, Reality Winner, was charged Monday with leaking an NSA document that details Russian efforts to penetrate U.S. election systems.

"Updated 6:56 p.m. ET

Senate Republicans on Thursday released a revised version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.

The new version comes after the Congressional Budget Office found that the original BCRA would in the next decade increase the uninsured population by 22 million over what it would otherwise be. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped for a vote before July 4, but was forced to delay that because he couldn't garner the 50 votes he needed among the 52 GOP senators.

The question now is whether this version of the bill could pass the Senate. Shortly after its release, Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul both said they intend to vote against letting the bill go forward. With two no votes, Vice President Pence could provide the 51st vote needed for passage. But if three Republican senators defect, the bill cannot pass.

The new bill makes some big changes from the last BCRA draft, but it also leaves some major parts of the original Senate proposal intact — it would still repeal the individual and employer mandates, it would still mean cuts to Medicaid spending, and it would still allow states to opt out of key parts of Obamacare.

In their summary of the bill, Senate Republicans laid out the major provisions. Here are some of those big changes that this new version of the bill would make to the original BCRA, and what they would mean:

Health savings accounts will be able to pay for premiums. Under IRS rules, people with high-deductible plans are eligible for health savings accounts (HSAs), accounts into which people can put money for health care expenses tax-free. Under this bill, people would for the first time be able to use that money for premiums. Americans' deposits in HSAs have ballooned over the last decade, according to HSA consulting firm Devenir. However, those accounts also tend to benefit higher-income people more than others, as Kaiser Health News' Michelle Andrews wrote in December — for example, richer people are more likely to have the extra money to sock away for health expenses.

More money for the opioid epidemic. The Senate's initial bill offered $2 billion to address the opioid crisis for 2018. This version would offer about $45 billion over 10 years, which is what Republicans Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito had requested at one point. However, some experts say that around $4.5 billion a year is nowhere near enough for combating America's massive opioid epidemic, as the New York Times reported in June.

Keeping some Obamacare taxes. The first BCRA version would have repealed an array of Affordable Care Act taxes, which would have overwhelmingly benefited higher-income Americans. This newer version of the bill keeps some in place, including the net investment income tax and a payroll tax that hit higher-income Americans.

Allowing insurers to offer non-Obamacare-qualified plans. This mirrors an idea that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee had proposed in recent weeks: The Senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. As long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of Obamacare's Title I (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.

That idea had created worries of a two-tiered insurance system — one in which older and sicker people would opt into the more comprehensive plans, while younger and healthier people would choose the cheaper plans that covered less, potentially causing a ""death spiral"" on the exchanges for those older and sicker people.

Extra stabilization money, in part for high-risk customers. The original version of the BCRA provided $112 billion that would have allowed states to stabilize their markets or help high-risk customers in a wide variety of ways. In this version, that is bumped up to $182 billion. One function of this money is to mitigate some of the two-tier issues created by new, nonqualified plans. If an insurer offers a plan that meets the Obamacare criteria, that insurer would be eligible for money to help high-risk customers.

This all means that the new version doesn't make major changes to one big part of the BCRA: Medicaid. Under the original Senate bill, the Obamacare Medicaid expansion would be rolled back, and Medicaid spending would be capped — states would either be allotted a certain amount per capita, or they could get a block grant instead. It also caps Medicaid spending growth in the medium-to-long-term. This bill doesn't change any of that.

According to the CBO, the original BCRA would have cut Medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years, and would have resulted in 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than under current law.

A new CBO score on the bill is expected Monday or Tuesday. By the end of next week, there is likely to be a key procedural vote. That would put things on track for a final vote the following week.

Were this bill to pass the Senate, it would then have to be reconciled with the House's attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, known as the American Health Care Act.

Meanwhile, Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina released an alternative plan Thursday morning.

A summary of the bill is embedded below. You can read the full draft here, and see the previous Senate version here.

Washington Desk editor Arnie Seipel contributed to this report.

This report has been updated to reflect that the extra $70 billion for stabilization funding will be in part used for helping insurers defray the costs of high-risk individuals.

"In his first interview with NPR, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has a wide-ranging interview with Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep.

Steve Inskeep: I want to begin with North Korea. We heard when you said, ""the era of strategic patience is over,"" so we know what your policy is not. Is there a word or phrase you can give us to say what your approach to North Korea is?

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: Yes, our approach to North Korea is to have them change their posture towards any future talks.

And I think when we say the era of strategic patience is over — in the past I think we have always negotiated our way to the negotiating table. Now when they act up, we would negotiate our way to get them to come to the table, and then decide what we're going to give them to have them behave. We don't have the running room left to do that now, given how far advanced their program has become. So this is an approach that is to put pressure on them through implementation of all the sanctions, as well as other diplomatic pressures, and calling on others to cause them to change their view of what will really allow them to achieve the security that they say they seek.

Do you intend to direct talks with North Korea? Is that your goal?

Obviously, that would be the way we would like to solve this. But North Korea has to decide they're ready to talk to us about the right agenda — and the right agenda is not simply stopping where they are for a few more months or a few more years and then resuming things. That's been the agenda for the last 20 years.

Well help me understand what success is from your point of view. What does the goal have to be?

Well our goal is the same as that of China, which is a denuclearized Korean peninsula.

No nuclear weapons for North Korea?

A denuclearized Korean Peninsula. It's very clear: That's China's stated policy, it has been our stated policy, it's been the stated policy of our allies in the region. And I would quickly add, you know, we did our part — we took our nuclear weapons out of the Korean Peninsula. It's time for North Korea to take their weapons out as well.

Is that a realistic goal?

It is our goal. It is our only goal.

And would you go so far as to say that is an absolute goal? I'm thinking of the way that President Obama during the nuclear negotiations with Iran said Iran will not have a nuclear weapon, period. Are you prepared to say: North Korea will not end this process with nuclear weapons, period?

We must have a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. That is our goal, pure and simple.

Nothing less?

Nothing less.

Regardless of the methods?

I'm not sure what you mean when you say regardless of the methods...

I guess I'm asking if that's a red line for you — North Korea keeping any nuclear weapons at all.

We don't have any red lines. I think what you're talking about perhaps is — how do we get there? And we say: We can't begin the process of getting there until North Korea comes to the table with a willingness to talk about how we get there — and how they achieve their objective.

You know, if you listen to the North Koreans and the regime of Pyongyang, their reason for having nuclear weapons is, they believe it is their only pathway to secure the ongoing existence of their regime. What we hope to convince them is: You do not need these weapons to secure the existence of your regime.

Meaning you could assure the existence, or the continued existence of the regime?

We have been very clear as to what our objectives are. And equally clear what our objectives are not. And we do not seek regime change, we do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula. We seek a denuclearized Korean Peninsula — and again that is entirely consistent with the objectives of others in the region as well.

Mr. Secretary, people will know that you're trying to work through China on this and make sure that China is applying the appropriate pressure — one of many things you're trying to deal with China on. I'd like to ask about the relationship between the president and the president of China, Xi Jinping. How important is that personal relationship between the two leaders?

Well it's extraordinarily important, first to just the broader relationship of where U.S.-China relations are going to find themselves over the next two to three to four decades. I think we are at a bit of an inflection point in the U.S.-China relationship. Now, North Korea is a threat that presents itself right up front to both of us, and in our conversations with the Chinese — and we have been very clear to them. I was on my initial trips to Beijing, and then in the visit of President Xi to Mar-a- Lago, the president and I were able to be very clear to them that things have to change in North Korea. And we need their help doing that.

Now, we like for them to help, we want them to help. If they believe for their own reasons they cannot help, then if they'll just let us know, we'll take that into consideration as we go forward. I think to this point, what China is beginning to re-evaluate is whether North Korea is any kind of an asset to them, or whether North Korea themselves and the regime have become a liability to China's own security. Because as I've said to my Chinese counterparts, those missiles go in all directions. And whether this regime is one that they feel is reliable for them to continue to work with.

When you say two or three or four decades, suddenly many things beyond North Korea are on the table. China wants to dominate its region. It wants to dominate the South China Sea, has a different view of the world than the United States. How do you persuade China to see its interests differently, and in a less threatening manner to the United States long-term?

Well I think we need to understand one another much better, and understand that China is on a pathway of continuing to emerge with their own people, in terms of providing a quality of life to their own population. You know, they've made enormous progress over the last 10 to 15 years — 500 million Chinese have moved out of poverty into middle-class status — but there's still a large country with a lot of people that are still living in poverty. So they are still on this pathway to prosperity. Our understanding of them — and I think they need to have an understanding of us — is that we do not seek to constrain their need to continue their economic growth and to continue to help their people enjoy a better quality of life. As they are pursuing that, though, they have to do that in a way that supports stability around the rest of the world as well.

Does that mean they need to constrain their ambitions or that you need to constrain them?

Not their economic ambitions.

Their strategic ambitions — their ambitions to power?

Well, it depends on how they view those strategic ambitions and whether those present a threat to stability for the rest of the world or not. And I think, you know, a specific example obviously is their activity towards island-building in the South China Sea, and in particular their militarization of those islands. We have had very, very frank conversations and exchanges with the Chinese around these activities, and our view that this destabilizes the areas of the South China Sea rather than create stability. And it represents a threat to others in the region that are going to be important to China's economic prosperity as well.

So we're hopeful that we can find common ground to work together with them to deescalate this particular activity of theirs and find some point of stability working with them. We're on the very front end of our relationship with the Xi government and we have put in place some mechanisms to begin this exchange of understanding each other better and seeing if we cannot chart a pathway forward that accommodates the interest of China but also accommodates the interest of the American people — our own national security — but stability for the region and the world as well.

Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you about your new job. Some people will know that your old company had a mission statement that Exxon wanted to be the premier petroleum company in the world. What's your mission statement for the State Department, if any?

I think our mission here is to deliver on the president's policies to secure — to provide the national security needs of the American people, and to advance America's economic interest around the world.

And I think the issue for us is how well we deliver on that mission through all of the various aspects of what State Department involves, from diplomacy, to our assistance programs, to helping nations that are just emerging, to dealing with conflicts, and our role of de-conflicting areas and solving conflicts. So it's all about how we deliver on that mission.

Do you see a department that wasn't delivering in some key areas?

Our administration, the Trump administration, has a different approach to how the administration wants to utilize the State Department in delivery of the mission. And I think that is developing. We're in the early days, again, in terms of how the National Security Council itself functions and how the president wants to use this State Department. And I'm confident the men and women of the State Department, whom I've been very impressed with since I arrived, are going to deliver on that mission. All we have to help them understand is — what do we want them to do. And I'm confident they're going to deliver on it.

Although, when you talk about a 31 percent budget cut, it suggests you think some of the functions of this department are not necessary, or are not paying off.

Well, I think if they if one looks at the State Department over the last, say, decade, if you look at a chart from 10 years ago and you look at a chart today, there's a lot of added boxes on that chart. Now, and this is not as simple as just putting x's through boxes. We are undertaking a reorganization of the State Department, but it's not just a collapse of boxes. What we really want to do is examine the process by which the men and women — the career foreign service people, the civil servants, our embassies — how they deliver on that mission.

And we want to hear from them — we're just about to embark on a department-wide listening mission. I know, because I've had a few interactions with people over lunch, some of our folks that are kind of at the 10- to 12-year stage of their career — where they're young and energetic but they've been around long enough to see what works and what doesn't — I look forward to hearing their ideas. Because I know there's going to be opportunities to allow them to be more effective. Now, out of that we'll determine what the State Department looks like. There is no predisposed outcome, though.

You have a unique opportunity — because you come from outside the world of diplomacy, because you have an outsider's eyes and you've had an opportunity in the last couple of months to look around and just ask, why? Why are things this way? What are some specific ""why"" questions you've posed to your people?

Well, I want to be careful about getting into the specifics because I don't want people to feel like they've been outed...

I want you to be uncareful about the specifics, but...

But I would tell you that, you know, there are a lot of rules — and people follow the rules, and you look at the rule, and you say, well, as you said, ""why do we do it that way?"" And no one can seem to remember why we did it that way. Now, I'm sure the rule was put in place once upon a time to address a specific situation, and then because of the way our government changes every four, eight years, a lot of these rules get left in place and no one ever goes back to reexamine them.

So we encounter a lot of those, and people are frustrated by that. I hear from them, you know, that they're frustrated — and then we say, well then let's get rid of that rule. Well that would be rather chaotic to just do it that way so that's part of this whole exercise that we're about to go through is, let's try to expose and examine places where we're really getting in our own way with things that have been put in place in the past.

Is there a policy — not just an internal rule, but a policy — that's made you say why are we approaching Pakistan that way? Why do we treat sub-Saharan Africa that way?

Well, I would say what I have encountered more often than not is the absence of a policy, the absence of a well-articulated policy.

And so it's not that people weren't doing things that were worthwhile, but they were doing things without a clear direction as to what was the end state we were trying to achieve? So one of the things we are doing early on — and we have to take this kind of country-by-country, region-by-region — is to look at our presence there and what is the end state, what are we trying to achieve on behalf of the American people? What's in our national security interest? What's in our economic interest? Do we know what that looks like? ""In a perfect world, this is where we would want this to be."" Then it allows people to drive their mission towards that end state.

And what I found more often than not is, there's not a clearly articulated policy around a particular region. Clearly we want to go help people. We want to de-conflict. Do we understand why, and what we're trying to achieve in the longer run?

What's the end state with Russia? The ideal end state, of course.

I think we would like to have a relationship with Russia where they do not threaten, or they don't pose a threat, to the United States or to any of the Western part of the world; that Russia wants to be a positive member of the global world order. They will have, always have, their own interests that they have to represent. But they want to be a positive part of the global world order, not a disruptive part and not a threat to others.

I'm thinking about the fact that we're talking on a day when the United Nations Ambassador, Nikki Haley, has made more statements criticizing Russia for its involvement in human rights abuses, effectively, in Syria and it makes me wonder if the odds of an improved relationship with Russia have gone down since the administration has taken office.

I don't think the odds have changed one way or the other. I think the situation is — as I assessed it, and this is what I, in fact, said in my trip to Moscow, my meetings with foreign minister Lavrov and with President Putin — is, my assessment is the U.S.- Russia relationship is at an all-time low, the lowest point it has been since the end of the Cold War. And I would tell you that their response was they didn't disagree with that.

I said we have a very low — almost no level of trust between us. And that my statement on that was: This cannot be the relationship to exist between the two most powerful nuclear nations on the planet. We cannot have this kind of relationship. And it's in a downward spiral — we've got to stabilize it and we've got to begin to understand how we're going to turn this around.

Now we talked about a broad range of areas that we're going to have to address. We didn't solve anything in that meeting — I didn't expect we would — but we had a very open, frank exchange on where we stand today, and do we want to address that or not? And we will be having further meetings in the future about it.

Do your personal relationships in Russia help at all? Or is this really just a national calculation of interest, and they see their interest differently than the United States will see its interests?

Well I think Russia is going to act in Russia's best interest. This is what all nations do. I think to the extent that I have longstanding relationships with the leadership in Russia, to the extent that's helpful in that they already know me — they don't have to try to figure out who this guy Rex Tillerson is because they've dealt with me for so many years — perhaps that's helpful. In that my ability to communicate is very straightforward, very candid, it's not nuanced, because I have found in dealing with the Russian leadership in the past — that is what they respect.

Two other things, Mr. Secretary. You've indicated that this department needs direction, but you're undertaking a review of the department's purpose and you're leaving a lot of senior jobs unfilled, perhaps for quite a long time. Is this department, are your diplomats around the world, going to get proper direction if they don't have a senior leadership other than you?

Well the leadership team's coming. It's been a little slower than even I would have hoped, but these people are, they are moving through the system and we will begin to fill many of these positions.

I think what's important for everyone to understand though is, while those positions have been open, we have terrific career foreign service officers and civil servants who have stepped up. And I can't tell you how pleased I've been with how they have conducted themselves in these acting roles. And this is tough for people to do when they know they may or may not remain in these positions longer-term.

But these are career professionals — they're looking for direction, they want to help us achieve the mission. And with the very rarest of exceptions, the folks at the State Department have performed remarkably well for me and the team I do have here in helping us develop and advance the president's foreign policies.

Do foreign diplomats take them seriously, or think they're dealing with the B-team?

No, they take all of our representatives seriously. Most of these folks have longstanding relationships in place in these countries. They're well-known. And when they know that they're speaking for this administration, they're taken seriously.

We are sitting in the George C. Marshall room. And in fact, George C. Marshall is looking down at us from his portrait here. Pretty intense gaze. Marshall, of course, was known for the Marshall Plan and for the phrase ""enlightened self-interest"" — helping other nations in order to help the United States. Some people would presume that President Trump has a very, very different approach to foreign policy and to U.S. interests in the world. Is it different? And if so, how?

I think perhaps it's just articulated a bit differently. When the president says he wants to put America first, I think that is the correct position to take — because I think too often we have compromised America's interests thinking that we were going to enhance it in the approach we take with others. I think what the president has said — I'm willing to look at a broad range of options, but I want to know at the end of it that the American people have won, and that we have come out with a stronger national security for the American people, and we've come out with a stronger economic posture and a better future for prosperity. And that doesn't mean that that comes at the expense of other nations — it means as we're developing those policies and we're developing how we want to interact with other nations, we never lose sight of where we have to end up at the end of it. Because if we're not strong, we cannot promote all the values of this nation that represent the very best of this world to others.

But with that said, does that mean that if there were a need for another Marshall Plan, to spend billions of American dollars somewhere, the president would be open to that?

If it is going to solve serious national security threats to the U.S., if it's going to put us on a stronger economic future and prosperity because of stability — we don't prosper well in an unstable world — then the president's going to be open, I think, to any plan. And I know a lot of people look at certain parts of the world that are in a lot of trouble today as to, how are we ever going to rebuild these? Well, we don't have to do it by ourselves.

And I think that's the president's message as well is: We will lead — we will be the first out there to lead — but this is in the interest of so many other countries as well, and we expect you, and we're going to hold you accountable, to stepping in and doing your part in stabilizing these regions as well. And so I think that's what's reflected, whether it's in the president's call for everyone to step up and do their part for NATO, or whether it's in the president's call for everyone to step up and do their part in stabilizing the Middle East, Syria, Iraq, and other regions. He is saying: We will be there, we will provide the leadership, we will put our shoulder to it — but we're not going to do this alone. Everyone has to come with us.

"Updated 6:30 p.m. ET

The Justice Department has asked for more time to respond to a congressional committee about any evidence that President Barack Obama ordered surveillance of then-candidate Donald Trump last year, as Trump has claimed.

The House Intelligence Committee had set the deadline of Monday in a letter to Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente last week in which it asked for proof of the claim, which Obama and others have said is baseless.

Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and ranking Democrat Adam Schiff requested any applications for surveillance of Trump or his associates that were made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any court orders supporting such surveillance made by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, NPR's David Welna reports.

David adds that a copy of the letter also was sent to FBI Director James Comey, who has asked the Justice Department to publicly deny President Trump's claims.

Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!

The Justice Department issued this statement Monday:

""This afternoon, the Department of Justice placed calls to representatives of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to ask for additional time to review the request in compliance with the governing legal authorities and to determine what if any responsive documents may exist.""

The wiretapping claims came as the House Intelligence Committee was already in the process of looking into U.S. allegations that Russia sought to influence last year's presidential election — allegations that have also included ties between some in Trump's camp and Russian officials. Nunes has said the panel will also look at the president's accusation.

Sen. John McCain is among those who have asked for proof of Trump's claim, telling CNN on Sunday, ""I think the president has one of two choices: either retract or ... provide the information that the American people deserve, because, if his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least.""

Monday's deadline came more than a week after Trump said Obama ""was tapping my phones in October,"" in a series of tweets that accused his predecessor of ""McCarthyism"" and called Obama a ""Bad (or sick) guy!""

Trump did not provide any evidence to bolster his claim; instead, the White House released a statement calling for Congress to investigate the allegations made by one president against another.

As NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Trump's claim is seen as having its origins in a March 2 broadcast by conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, who accused Obama ""and his surrogates"" of using ""intelligence activities to surveil members of the Trump campaign"" to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. After that, David said, the claim was repeated by the Breitbart website.

""That seems to have inspired, very directly, a series of tweets,"" Folkenflik said.

Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis says the Obama White House observed a policy against interfering with ""any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.""

Lewis added, ""As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.""

The morning after Trump made his claim, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it on ABC's This Week; here's what she said: ""Look, I think he is going off of information that he's saying that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential.""

"For reaction to the Senate Republican health care bill that was made public last week, Rachel Martin talks to Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 

First comes the bill. Now comes the price tag. This morning, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its score of the Senate version of the Republican health care bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that, with that in hand, he wants to push forward for a vote on this bill by the end of the week. So far, national polls show that the latest plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is generally unpopular with many Americans. The bill has many industry critics, too, like our next guest. His name is Dan Mendelson, and he is the president of the consulting firm Avalere Health.

Thanks so much for being with us this morning.

DAN MENDELSON: It's my pleasure to be here.

MARTIN: We're expecting a CBO score on the Senate bill today, as I mentioned. Any way to anticipate what that might say?

MENDELSON: Well, our estimates are that the bill probably eliminates coverage for about 20 million low-income individuals. And then it's going to save the federal government a lot of money, primarily due to the reductions in Medicaid spending over time.

MARTIN: So that hews really closely with what the House bill did. That was going to cut nearly 23 million more Americans from health insurance and also make significant reductions in the federal deficit. What do you make of the proposed cuts to Medicaid? The draft bill proposes cutting Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars. Republicans say this is about giving the power to the states to allocate their own Medicaid spending. What's the risk there?

MENDELSON: Yeah, what the bill does is it limits increases in Medicaid spending over time, and it puts in place a hard and fast mechanism to enforce that states will be keeping their Medicaid spending under control. And, you know, it's - this is problematic, I think, primarily due to the coverage effects that we just talked about. But then, also, it potentially threatens institutions, like hospitals that serve the poor and really derive a lot of their revenues from doing that.

MARTIN: The bill also removes the mandate for people to buy insurance, which means there's no penalty if you don't have it, no incentive for people to get it. Is that going to be untenable for insurance companies in the end?

MENDELSON: You know, interestingly, I think that, right now, we have to acknowledge the fact that the mandate is simply not working. There are about 10 million people covered under the exchanges right now. If the mandate were working, we'd probably have about 25. So, you know, in the current situation with the mandate really not working, then the question really is, how do you get individuals who really should be insured under this program signed up?

I think that there is an issue with the bill in that it would allow someone to decide not to be covered, wait for a long time and then only when they're ill, sign up for coverage. I do expect that the Senate will be addressing that issue at some point over the course of the week.

MARTIN: So is this a good bill or a bad bill? I mean, is this something you could support?

MENDELSON: Look, fortunately I don't have to make that decision because I'm not sitting in the Senate. I think that, really, you have to look at the primary effects of the bill, which are problematic for low-income individuals. It's the Medicaid reductions and the fact that so many people would not be covered over time. And those are really the primary effects.

MARTIN: Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm, thanks so much for your time this morning.

MENDELSON: My pleasure.

"Updated on Dec. 22 on 12:02 p.m. ET

Congressional Republicans delivered on their first major legislative accomplishment of the Trump era on Wednesday, when the House voted 224-201 to pass a $1.5 trillion tax package. The bill cuts individual rates for eight years and slashes the top corporate tax rate to 21 percent permanently. 

Trump signed the bill into law on Friday, hailing the legislation as ""a bill for the middle class and a bill for jobs,"" adding that he was ""very honored by it.""

In an event on the White House lawn Wednesday afternoon, the president, Vice President Pence and lawmakers celebrated and thanked each other for their work on the bill's passage.

""I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting,"" Trump said in a written statement earlier in the day. ""I would like to thank the members of Congress who supported this historic bill, which represents an extraordinary victory for American families, workers, and businesses.""

Republican lawmakers hoped to put the bill over the goal line a day earlier, after the House claimed victory in a 227-203 vote Tuesday afternoon, but hit a procedural hurdle. The Senate passed the bill with some slight tweaks in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a party-line vote, 51-48. 

""This is a historic night,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said after the vote. 

The bill has been in the works for months. Republican leaders put a marker down at the beginning of the year to pass a tax bill by the end of the summer, though that had depended on passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act in the spring, an effort that dragged out but ultimately did not materialize. The tax bill accomplishes part of that goal by eliminating the penalty for  individuals who don't get health insurance. 

Republicans say that public opinion of the bill, which has been very low, will turn around as people start to feel the effect of tax cuts. 

""When people see their withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's going to produce the results,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday. ""Results are going to make this popular.""

The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!

People across income levels will see a tax cut of some sort under the bill, though most of the benefits will go to top earners. By February, federal income tax withholding is expected to be adjusted in paychecks, but for most people, the changes may not be apparent until April 2019 when 2018 taxes will be due for annual filers.

The GOP has long sought a big overhaul of the tax code to simplify it by eliminating complex tax breaks and lowering rates, but in the end, the tax bill did not do much to actually simplify the code.  

Individual tax rates are cut for eight years, though a future Congress could choose to extend them instead of allowing an effective tax increase to take place at the end of 2025. ""We have no intention of allowing that to happen,"" Ryan, R-Wis., said to CBS This Morning on Wednesday. 

The projection that the bill would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years grows to $2 trillion if those individual tax cuts are made permanent, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., referred in a floor speech to ""the ludicrous Republican insistence — their claim — that these giveaways to the wealthiest will pay for themselves."" GOP leaders have insisted that reducing taxes on the corporate side of the ledger will result in higher wages and more money being brought back to the U.S. from overseas business operations, but many economists doubt that the bill will spur significant economic growth or avoid adding to the national debt. 

Republican leaders have spoken of reducing entitlement spending as a priority for next year. ""We need to keep focused on the spending side of the ledger, as well, "" Ryan told ABC's Good Morning America, when he mentioned revisiting health care spending and welfare reform, which President Trump has also focused on. 

Democrats have been unable to break GOP unity to stop the tax bill as they were able to over health care, though they have said they look forward to how it will play in the 2018 midterm elections as they argue it's a boon for the wealthy.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted that Republicans will ""rue the day"" they voted for the tax bill.  

I believe the entire Republican Party, will come to rue the day they voted for the #GOPTaxScam.

That day was delayed because of Senate rules, which prevent the bill from including any measures considered ""extraneous"" to budget matters. After the House passed what was believed to be the final version of the bill on Tuesday, Democratic senators challenged provisions relating to education and a technical issue over the naming of the bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that they did not fit inside the budget rules that the bill is being passed under, which allow it to be approved by a simple 51-vote majority, bypassing any risk of a Democratic filibuster.

"A bipartisan group of senators has taken a step to limit the Trump administration's ability to ease sanctions on Russia, adding an amendment to a widely supported Iran sanctions bill to make sure Congress has a say in future Russia policy. The Senate is considering the bill this week.

The amendment ensures that Congress has time to review any plans by the Trump administration to relax, suspend or terminate sanctions — some of which were imposed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and supported separatists in Eastern Ukraine, in a conflict that is ongoing.

The Obama administration expanded sanctions in December 2016, after accusing the Russian government of meddling in U.S. elections and harassing American diplomats.

With the Trump team now under scrutiny for contact with the Russians during the campaign, many lawmakers are worried that the White House is looking to ease up on that pressure.

""We think that is a fundamental policy shift for the United States that needs to be done in sunlight and therefore a review of Congress is urgent,"" says Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

The amendment would also slap new sanctions on Russians involved in human rights violations, those supplying weapons to the Syrian government and those conducting ""malicious cyber activity on behalf of the Russian government.""

A third part is aimed at helping countries in Central and Eastern Europe counter disinformation from Russia.

""We know that Russia is actively engaged in cyber attacks on democratic institutions. We experience it firsthand,"" Cardin told a group of journalists Monday before announcing an agreement on the amendment with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and colleagues from the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The amendment incorporates language from earlier bills the senators had introduced this year.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been trying to find areas of cooperation with Russia. He is sending a top State Department official, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, to St. Petersburg on June 23 to work through some ""irritants.""

That includes the possibility of allowing Russia to regain access to compounds in New York and Maryland that the Obama administration seized last December, saying Russia was using the compounds for intelligence activities.

""We have a large place mat of difficult issues with Russia,"" Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a budget hearing on Tuesday, explaining that he is trying to ""stabilize"" relations.  

Tillerson said the Trump administration's talks with Russia about Syria are ""progressing in a positive way"" and he argued that he does not want to close any channels to Russia at this time. However, he did not outline any progress that might pave the way for an easing of sanctions.

"Algorithms are a crucial part of how the news reaches you in a digital world. But we know many people find them opaque and controversial. Filter Bubble is an expression coined to capture the way an algorithm can measure what you like and just feed you more and more of that until all you get is one perspective.

We want to raise the curtain and explain how we use an algorithm at NPR One.

If you run a Google search on the word ""algorithm"" it will be explained as ""a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer."" There's nothing inherent to an algorithm that makes it good or bad. It is just a set of procedures. The question to ask is what are the people who programmed the algorithm trying to accomplish in using it?

In building NPR One, our commitment was to maintain the core values of NPR's journalism while taking advantage of the abilities of a digital platform to customize a listening experience for you. When you listen to a radio show, the producer of the show has made editorial decisions about what you hear. When you listen to NPR One, the algorithm is an editorial tool we are using to ensure you get the appropriate pieces and recommendations at the right time.

So here is what you can expect from NPR One's personalization algorithm:

NPR One will always give you the lead story of the day and the important stories that our editors have chosen. Experienced news producers and editors make the decisions about what stories need to be offered to you to ensure that you are well informed and that you get a couple of surprise selections that might be things you didn't know you were interested in. We know you value getting both the information you need along with the serendipity of discovering something new—that is the heart and soul of NPR. We've set up our personalization algorithm to ensure this is a big part of the NPR One listening experience.

Stories are categorized in NPR One. Different types of stories act differently and allow for more or less personalization. Important news stories get presented to everyone with no personalization. As does another type of story which are ones that are hand chosen by editors to give you breadth and a little serendipity.

But there are other stories where it isn't essential that everyone hears them, stories that are basically ""water cooler"" sorts of stories or stories that are more particular to one person's tastes and interests. With stories like this we feel the algorithm should support your interests. For instance, NPR One can learn that you don't really like long interviews with novelists, lots of sports stories, or music reviews. However, even in those cases, our personalization algorithm is designed to periodically double check your preferences by offering you something it thinks you'd prefer not to get, just to make sure. And if something in one of these categories is particularly newsworthy, our editors can make sure it isn't subject to personalization so you'll be offered the story. We're also working on improvements to the personalization algorithm to learn even more about the topics you favor. This will help you dive deep into topics you are particularly interested in, while still ensuring you get a clear view of the broader world. Our goal is to help you break filter bubbles.

The other place where we rely on our personalization algorithm is for determining what podcasts are recommended for you. Most podcasts are not where you turn for your essential news. So, in this area, we feel we can make heavier use of an algorithm to make choices about what to play and recommend. Our editorial curators still have the ability to decide to present a certain particularly noteworthy podcast far and wide to our listeners, but we feel that podcasts are another area where a personalization algorithm has real power to improve your listening experience without compromising editorial values.

Ironically, while algorithms have been blamed for fostering ""bubbles"" where you see, read, and hear only the things that reflect your world view, we can use the NPR One algorithm to ensure that you actually get editorial balance. It is not uncommon for our on-air broadcasts to feature one point of view one day and the other point of view on another day. Maybe you will hear both if you listen on-air, or maybe you won't. It will depend on whether you tuned in at the right time. With NPR One, we can have our personalization algorithm make sure you get both. It also gives us the ability to make sure you get a follow up story when something changes or a correction is made. This is an example of how the use of an algorithm can actually be more editorially responsible rather than less so.

Ultimately, an algorithm is just another editorial tool. Most of the work the NPR One personalization algorithm does is benign housekeeping such as making sure you are getting the most recent important stories, that you aren't hearing the same story twice, and that you get stories from your local station not some other one. But algorithms can also be setup to maximize whatever it is that the website, social media outlet, or news organization values most—in NPR One's case, that is stories that start conversations, increase understanding, enrich lives, and enliven minds.

"President Trump will try to leave his troubles behind as he departs on the first foreign trip of his presidency. It's an ambitious itinerary with stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican and two meetings with European leaders.

Here are five objectives to watch for as Trump goes overseas.

1. Will the cloud of controversy follow?

There has been one ""bad news"" headline after another involving the Trump administration breaking every day this week. But if the president is looking for a reprieve, recent history indicates he might be disappointed.

The White House press corps is going on the trip and will no doubt try to press him on why he really fired FBI Director James Comey, whether he leaked classified information to the Russians in an Oval Office meeting, and why he hired former national security adviser Mike Flynn even after Flynn notified the transition team that he was under investigation by the FBI. And there are likely to be more developments back in Washington even as he's abroad.

There's precedent for this: In 2016 when President Barack Obama traveled overseas, he was asked repeatedly — almost exclusively it seemed — about the presidential campaign and then-candidate Donald Trump. Obama's agenda and announcements on those trips were completely overshadowed by the campaign.

When President Bill Clinton went on trips, questions followed about the various investigations surrounding him and his administration.

There's essentially no escape from domestic politics for presidents no matter where they are. That said, the leaders in Saudi Arabia are not obsessed with the American FBI director and possible Russian meddling in the campaign in the way that the media and many Americans may be. Thus, the first leg of his trip, at least, Trump is less likely to hear about these things from his hosts.

2. Getting out of his comfort zone

Every president going back to Ronald Reagan has started smaller, with their first international journeys taking them to America's neighbors, either Canada or Mexico. Trump's first trip is much farther from home.

Trump is known to be a homebody, someone who greatly prefers sleeping in his own bed, golfing at his own courses and dining at his own properties. During the campaign, he returned to Trump Tower in New York most nights, even if he had been campaigning on the other end of the country.

This trip will take the president out of his comfort zone. How will he adapt? We'll all know soon.

One thing that might help put Trump at ease is that his wife, Melania, is traveling with him for the entire trip.

Also, The Associated Press reports that caterers in Saudi Arabia will have the option of steak with ketchup (the president's preferred meal) in addition to local cuisine.

3. A message for the three Abrahamic religions

Trump is visiting Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican, and it isn't a coincidence. His advisers say he wanted to visit these three major religious centers to deliver a message of unity in the fight against terrorism.

Trump is ""bringing people the world over to understand we are in this together,"" said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at a press conference. ""This is not a battle about religions. This is not a battle about cultures. This is a battle about good and evil. And their — the goodness of people of all faiths will prevail over this evil.""

In Saudi Arabia, Trump is scheduled to give a speech to the leaders of some 50 Muslim-majority countries. National security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump will call on the Muslim leaders to ""promote a peaceful vision of Islam.""

And yes, this message will come from the same person who proposed a ""Muslim ban"" during the campaign and has said things that have been widely perceived as being opposed to the Islamic religion. Trump faces a delicate task.

4. Meeting with Europeans

While Middle East experts expect Trump to be warmly welcomed in Saudi Arabia and Israel, he may be received in Europe with some trepidation.

Trump, during the campaign, said the NATO alliance was obsolete. Now that he's president, he says it isn't obsolete. But he still wants its members to pay their fair share, as he puts it, meaning that they should spend a larger share of gross domestic product on their own national defense, as the NATO charter calls for. Given Trump's shifting positions, Europe watchers say, leaders of countries in the alliance are concerned he could shift his position again in a way that is at cross purposes with their interests.

European leaders will make a big push to convince Trump that they are not getting credit for all the things they are doing to contribute to the alliance. One symbolic way they'll do that is by unveiling an ""Article 5"" memorial. Article 5 says an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. The memorial marks how the NATO countries responded to the Sept. 11 attack on America.

Trump will also meet the new French president, Emmanuel Macron. Although Trump didn't explicitly endorse Macron's opponent, Marine Le Pen, he clearly had an affinity for her nationalist ideas and she an affinity for his.

5. America First?

One thing we're going to see is the first road test of what ""American First"" means on the international stage. So far, in his interactions with world leaders, Trump has softened from more absolutist positions he had coming in: the shift on NATO, not tearing up NAFTA, deciding China isn't a currency manipulator after all, to name a few. What sorts of ""deliverables"" will Trump come away with from this trip and will he defer to the leaders he's meeting with or be persuaded by their arguments? We'll find out soon.

Though, the biggest goal of the trip may simply be to build bonds with the dozens of leaders he will cross paths with over the next nine days.

""President Trump understands that America First does not mean America alone, to the contrary,"" McMaster said. ""Prioritizing American interests means strengthening alliances and partnerships that help us extend our influence and improve the security of the American people.""

"FBI agents raided former Trump campaign ChairmanPaul Manafort's home, a spokesman for Manafort tells NPR's Tamara Keith. Manafort's name has come up as part of the U.S. investigation into Russia's attempt to meddle with last year's election.

The raid reportedly took place in late July, one month after Manafort registered as a foreign agent.

News of the raid in Alexandria, Va., was first reported by The Washington Post. A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, tells NPR:

""FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.""

The Post reports:

""Federal agents appeared at Paul Manafort's home without advance warning in the predawn hours of July 26, the day after he met voluntarily with the staff for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

""The search warrant was wide-ranging and FBI agents working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III departed the home with various records.""

Mueller, the former FBI director, has assembled a team to investigate Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties between Russians and associates of President Trump.

As part of his investigation, Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington, D.C. — a development seen as a sign that his work is intensifying.

Loading...

In late June, Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, registered as foreign agents with the U.S. Justice Department. According to documents filed with the government, a firm headed by Manafort ""made more than $17 million in two years working for the pro-Russia political party that controlled Ukraine's government,"" NPR's Jim Zarroli reported.

That party was headed by Ukraine's former president, Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Manafort has a long history as a lobbyist and political operative, having worked for both Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He also has longstanding ties to President Trump, who hired him back in the 1980s to work on lobbying issues for his real estate and gambling deals, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported.

Over the years, Manafort has represented a number of foreign entities, ""from governments in Nigeria and Kenya, the UNITA rebels in Angola and a group with ties to Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos,"" as Brian reported last summer.

In more recent years, Manafort worked for another Putin ally — Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska — whom the American approached in 2005 with the promise of providing influence in the U.S. and elsewhere. Millions of dollars changed hands in their collaboration, which lasted for several years and included investments in Ukraine, as Jim reported earlier this summer.

"People reduce themselves to the size of peanuts in search of a better life in Downsizing, and an entire colony's waste can fit inside one plastic bag. But the new sci-fi comedy from writer-director Alexander Payne is a gigantic mess at any proportion. It's the rare movie that seems to execute every part of its concept absolutely wrong; a narrative, tonal, visual and sociopolitical fiasco the likes of which haven't been seen in many moons. 

Fittingly for a piece of entertainment that means well but misfires at every turn, the film's star, Matt Damon, has been embroiled in his own series of blunders on the Downsizing publicity tour, stemming from his comments about Hollywood's sexual assault crisis. Damon probably wishes he could just shrink himself to nothing and disappear forever inside the film's ""Leisure Land,"" a pint-sized monument to the suburban male ego.

The sad thing about this movie is its core premise offers a solid glimpse of social satire, before Payne's runaway toy train flies off the rails completely. Norwegian scientists have invented a way to permanently shrink people and objects so small that entire cities can fit on one parking lot. The to-be-downsized are required to have all their hair shaved off, for no reason other than that it's quirky, and all their teeth removed because otherwise the film wouldn't haunt your nightmares. The scientists market the downsizing procedure as a means of combating overpopulation, but the hook that really brings them a core following in America is the promise that, once inside their fishnet-protected terrariums, the downsized can live like the kings and queens of Versailles on middle-class salaries. ""Best decision I ever made!"" one of the film's ""smalls"" shouts to a married couple of would-be converts from Nebraska (Damon and Kristen Wiig), from her perch in a special protected glass carrier on the bus, entirely at the mercy of the big people who choose on a daily basis not to squish her.

It turns out that downsizing is quite the elastic metaphor, and Payne stretches and kneads the concept like Silly Putty until it no longer resembles itself. It's the real-estate bubble (Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor wrote the first draft in 2009), but it's also an earthy health fad, like going gluten-free, and some sort of nebulous comment on civil rights as smalls get treated differently at restaurants and the like. Then it becomes a new torture, as despotic governments around the world shrink political opponents against their will — a bit of horror this wannabe-Capraesque fable is not remotely equipped to deal with, not least when we meet a major character who's a victim of this practice (more on her later).

The process of downsizing is most dramatically effective when treated as a major life change, the sort where characters get to utter the timeless phrase, ""I'll see you on the other side."" This is what leads to the film's first of many exhausting crises, when Damon's schlubby occupational therapist Paul goes through with the procedure only to find that his wife Audrey (Wiig) has backed out at the last minute.

What happens next is our first real hint at just how small-brained Downsizing truly is. During the moment of truth, Payne cuts to Wiig, bug-eyed and with a bald head and one eyebrow, hamming it up as she wails about how awful she feels. This is a serious moment in the narrative, right? She's abandoned her husband to a lifetime of shrinkage because she couldn't bring herself to live as a bug for the rest of her life. The film plays it for sour farce, asking us to laugh at a crazy lady who left her husband not-so-high and dry. Then it abandons her, so that we may have more time to watch a depressed Damon shuffle alone through his brand-new McMansion, eventually befriending a Eurotrash partier of dubious origin (Christoph Waltz, never more obnoxious) and slowly, sloooowly realizing that it might be nice to help other people for a change.

It's mind-boggling how little imagination, visual or otherwise, a movie about tiny people can have. Downsizing is written and shot in such a way as to frequently obscure the very fact of its characters' smallness. It's set largely in environments that were artificially constructed for the downsized, so that the houses, when shot from ""ground"" level, just look like normal homes (and once Paul gets downsized, almost every scene takes place inside a home; there's hardly any exploration of the ""larger"" world). The unpacking of this concept happens almost exclusively via dialogue, with throwaway lines about shipping boats in FedEx mailers instead of actually seeing a boat shipped in a FedEx mailer. There are moments of oddball charm, like the sight of a grown nurse prying a tiny naked man from a gurney with a spatula, but they're offset with lumpy, time-wasting scenes of Paul discovering hard partying and taking selfies.

Anyway, yes, that dissident. She's a Vietnamese activist named Ngoc Lan Tran, and played by Hong Chau with heavily broken English and strict, clipped speech. Chau, who was actively involved in the creation of the character, has fought accusations that Ngoc's mannerisms make her a stereotype, and insists she's ""not used as a punch line."" Nevertheless, the audience at one advance screening laughed uproariously every time she spoke lines like ""Need money for live"" and ""You help Gladys good,"" and the film presents her in such a way so that her true nature can't be seen or understood by anyone, not even potential love interests. So if this woman isn't a stereotype, who is she?

Maybe she's supposed to be the film's conscience. For Ngoc, who was forcibly shrunk by her government and shoved into a TV box destined for sale in America, being downsized is not a fantasy of a better life but a life sentence. She loses her leg on the journey, and hobbles on a prosthetic while cleaning apartments in the suburban nightmare kingdom, living in a makeshift walled-city trailer park just outside of town with all the other poor people, so she can teach humility to the white dollhouse man. You see, here is the grand acid joke of this whole affair — that even in an Incredibly Shrinking America where the value of the dollar is automatically inflated for one special class, there will always be foreigners within that class to do the dirty work for us.

Of course there's truth to a theme like this, but Payne presents his societal ant farm with the smug air of the enlightened man who's already figured all of this out and is just waiting for the rest of us to catch up. It's pretty brazen to point out that you're aware of the class differentials in your own movie, filling the margins with immigrants and working-class faces, while using this theme merely to underline your boilerplate middle-class midlife crisis. Downsizing is far from the first Payne film about pitiful older single men, but it's a far cry from Election, where the sad sack had a worthy adversary and the movie didn't seem to be taking massive effort to bend his way. By the time we reach the climax, which naturally concerns the end of the world, the delusions of grandeur that once defined Payne's sense of humor have hijacked the whole playpen. Amid all these bonkers plot twists and celebrity cameos, you might not even register that this film is slouching toward an argument for a master race.

How did we get here? Through the conclusion of Downsizing's premise that, if selfishness has destroyed the planet, it would take a degree of selfishness to save it. An army of Lilliputians drag our concept of life down until it only belongs to the smallest and most toothless among us, and for these interminable minutes, it's as though Planet Earth was never really big and beautiful at all.

A post on McDonald's corporate Twitter account caused a stir Thursday morning, denigrating President Trump and calling for Barack Obama's return. The tweet was up for about 20 minutes only — but in that time, it was liked and retweeted more than 1,000 times.

""You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back,"" said the tweet, which was briefly pinned to the top of the McDonald's page. It concluded, ""also you have tiny hands.""

McDonald's apologized, saying its account had been ""hacked by an external source.""

Based on our investigation, we have determined that our Twitter account was hacked by an external source. Read more: https://t.co/X5NwVI5sKp

Posted at 9:16 a.m. ET, the tweet quickly drew a wide range of responses — and guesses over whether it was the work of an external hacker or a disgruntled employee.

The tweet came as a significant departure on a corporate account that normally contents itself with marking holidays, promoting McDonald's outlets and informing investors about company strategy.

""I assume somebody decided to quit their social media job in style,"" reads one popular comment.

Others joked that perhaps the Hamburglar, the McDonald's cartoon character, had infiltrated the company's social media division. And some, assuming that the tweet would be short-lived, posted a Web Archives link to the message.

While people posting those early responses didn't seem to believe the message reflected a shift in McDonald's public stance on America's leadership, several of them did say that they're now planning to eat a Big Mac today.

Other reactions came from Trump supporters — within an hour, one Twitter user had asked McDonald's: ""Why would you post this! You think it's ok to insult our president? For the record Obama was a failure!""

That tweet included a new hashtag, #BoycottMcDonalds.

The now-deleted tweet comes one year after Trump explained his appreciation for McDonald's and other fast-food chains, saying on CNN that the restaurants were run to tight standards. And, he added, he likes the Filet-O-Fish as well as the burgers.

After clinching the Republican presidential nomination last May, Trump posted a photo of himself eating a meal from McDonald's on his private jet, in an image that inspired a number of digital retouches.

Less than a day after a monument of the Ten Commandments was installed outside the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock, it was destroyed when a man smashed a car into the stone.

Authorities say Michael T. Reed II drove a 2016 Dodge Dart into the 6,000-pound granite slab at about 4:47 a.m. local time on Wednesday.

""My boss called me and told me the Ten Commandments monument had been destroyed,"" Secretary of State and Capitol Police spokesman Chris Powell told NPR. ""When I got here, it was rolled over on the sidewalk and broken into multiple pieces.""

A video that appears to have been taken from inside the car was posted on the Facebook account of a Michael Reed early Wednesday; Powell told the AP that officials believe the video is authentic. It shows what looks like the Arkansas State Capitol building. A man's voice says: ""Oh my goodness. Freedom!"" as the car careens into the monument.

Powell said the crash into the 6-foot-tall slab was no accident.

""This was deliberate. The individual drove down there and stopped. He was videoing it on his cellphone as he accelerated into the monument,"" Powell said. ""One of our Capitol Police officers was on patrol and witnessed it.""

Reed, who police say is a 32-year-old white man from Van Buren, Ark., was arrested outside the Capitol and booked at the Pulaski County Jail. He faces preliminary charges of defacing an object of public respect, a Class C felony; criminal mischief in the first degree, a Class C felony; and trespassing on the state Capitol grounds, a misdemeanor.

Reed was arrested in 2014 for driving a car into the Ten Commandments monument at Oklahoma's state Capitol, Oklahoma County Sheriff's spokesman Mark Opgrande told The Associated Press. He was admitted to a hospital the next day for mental treatment and was not formally charged, the AP reports. In the 2014 incident, The Oklahoman reported that the U.S. Secret Service interviewed Reed and that he told agents that he has bipolar disorder and that Satan had directed him to destroy the monument.

The Tulsa World reported in 2015 that Reed sent the newspaper a letter apologizing for the destruction of the Oklahoma monument. ""I am so sorry that this all happening (sic) and wished I could take it all back,"" Reed wrote, explaining to the World that he had begun to believe the voices in his head.

Police said Wednesday that Reed was cooperative during his arrest and that, so far, there is no indication of motive.

The erection of the privately funded monument has been contentious. The Arkansas Legislature passed a law in 2015 requiring the installation of the monument on Capitol grounds. The Ten Commandments were erected Tuesday morning, and the ACLU of Arkansas has said it will sue for the monument's removal.

Meanwhile, Powell said Capitol workers are left picking up the (extremely heavy) pieces: ""Our crew is in the process of cleaning all that up and carting it off. They have to get a tractor and put it on pallets and lift it up.""

And the Dodge Dart was towed away, Powell said, adding, ""There was minor damage, but not what you'd think, from what I hear, from knocking over a big stone monument.""

Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert, who spearheaded the effort to install the Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol, says he wants to replace it, Michael Hibblen of member station KUAR reports.

""We will rebuild the monument,"" Rapert said. ""It will be put in place and hopefully protect it from any future harm.""

"One of Mexico's most respected journalists has been shot to death in his home state of Sinaloa, in northwestern Mexico, and a large group of gunmen has attacked seven other journalists traveling in the southwest.

A wave of attacks, several of them fatal, targeted reporters in Mexico over the past few months, NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico.

Javier Valdez, who was shot to death in Culiacán, Sinaloa, on Monday, was a veteran reporter admired for his dogged coverage of drug trafficking, organized crime and life in Mexico's underworld, Carrie reports. He was a correspondent for a national newspaper, La Jornada, and also ""founded the respected Riodoce publication and authored several books delving into narcotrafficking and organized crime.""

A gunman pulled Valdez from his car and shot him multiple times, according to La Jornada.

""Valdez was a nationally and internationally recognized journalist who authored several books on the drug trade, including Narcoperiodismo and Los Morros del Narco,"" The Associated Press reports. ""The latter chronicled the lives of young people swept up in Mexico's underworld.""

A spokesman for a Mexican human rights organization, CNDH, tells La Jornada the killing ""affects freedom of expression, and the very heart of Mexican democracy.""

""Sinaloa, Valdez's home state, is infamous in Mexico's drug world,"" Carrie says. ""It's also home to the Sinaloa cartel, which until recently was headed by Joaquin 'Chapo' Guzmán"" — the infamous drug lord who, after a high-profile escape and recapture, has been extradited to the U.S. and is awaiting trial.

The attack comes a day after a group of around 100 gunmen attacked seven journalists traveling through southwestern Mexico.

Carrie reports on the Sunday attack for our Newscast unit:

""The attack occurred on a highway near the town of Iguala in the state of Guerrero. According to reports, about 100 armed men attacked the reporters traveling together in two SUVs.

""The reporters were in the region covering a security operation. It is one of the most dangerous in the country, fueled by drug cartel violence. Three years ago, 43 teaching students were kidnapped and disappeared in the area.

""According to the national newspaper, La Jornada, two of its employees were among the journalists attacked. The gunmen, who the paper say appeared to be drugged, roughed up some of the reporters, then stole their cameras, cellphones and other personal effects.""

Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, the Committee to Protect Journalists says.

President Trump solemnly addressed the nation Monday morning about Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas, saying Americans are ""joining together in sadness, shock and grief.""

In brief remarks from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump called the shooting, in which police say at least 58 people were killed and over 500 were wounded, ""an act of pure evil."" He said he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, and he ordered flags flown at half-staff.

Trump praised first responders, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, ""for their courageous efforts."" He said the speed with which they reacted to the shooting was ""miraculous and prevented further loss of life."" Trump noted that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are working with local authorities on the investigation.

Trump said of the victims, most of whom were attending a country music concert, ""We cannot fathom their pain; we cannot imagine their loss."" The president quoted from Scripture that ""the Lord is close to the brokenhearted,"" and said he and first lady Melania Trump are praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded and for the families of the victims.

""In moments of tragedy and horror,"" Trump said, the nation ""comes together as one."" He continued, ""Our unity cannot be shattered by evil; our bonds cannot be broken by violence.""

In the afternoon, the president held a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House with the first lady and dozens of White House staffers.

Trump had been briefed earlier in the morning on the attack and tweeted, ""My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!""

The president's schedule had called for him to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday in light of the hurricane damage there, and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that is still the plan.

My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!

"Updated at 12:44 a.m. ET 

Democrat Doug Jones has won the Alabama Senate special election, a victory  that was a stunning upset in a deeply red state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump. The president, who had backed Republican Roy Moore despite multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, congratulated Jones on Twitter. 

Loading...

The win by Jones, projected by The Associated Press two hours after the polls closed Tuesday night, is sure to send shock waves through Washington. The special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate in February, was upended in November as multiple women came forward to say Moore had pursued them romantically as teenagers when he was in his 30s. Some alleged he had sexually assaulted them, including one woman who said he had initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14. Moore has denied the accusations.

The unfolding controversy made what should have been a safe GOP race anything but. It's the first Democratic Senate victory in the state in 25 years and now gives Republicans an even narrower, 51-49 Senate majority that could imperil GOP legislative priorities in 2018. Jones will be up for re-election to a full term in 2020. 

""Alabama has been at a crossroads. We have been at crossroads in the past, and unfortunately we have usually taken the wrong fork,"" Jones said in his victory speech. ""Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, you took the right fork.""

NBA legend Charles Barkley returned to his native Alabama to campaign for Jones in the closing days and told CNN after the Democrat's victory, ""We got a bunch of rednecks and ignorant people, but we got some amazing people here and they rose up today."" 

It's the first major electoral blow to Trump since his own upset victory just over a year ago, giving Democrats a special election win after several near misses. Democrats were victorious in November in the Virginia and New Jersey governors' races, but the win in such a red state that Trump won by almost 30 points is a political earthquake heading into the 2018 midterm elections.  

The president had come to Moore's defense, casting doubt on the women's allegations — much as he has done with the multiple women who have accused him of sexual assault. While Trump didn't campaign with Moore, he did hold a rally just across the border from Alabama in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday evening and recorded a robocall on his behalf, urging voters to choose Moore because he would support his agenda in the Senate. And after Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for Moore last week, the Republican National Committee reinstated its financial support for the GOP nominee after having pulled it following the accusations.

Trump was unusually restrained on Twitter late Tuesday, congratulating Jones and refraining from placing blame. 

Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!

Moore refused to concede Tuesday night, saying that his campaign would ""wait on God and let this process play out."" He pointed to the uncertain write-in totals he believed could still change the outcome and trigger a recount. However, there has to be a difference of 0.5 percent or less between the two candidates to trigger an automatic recount, and with almost all the votes in, Jones' margin of victory was about three times that. 

""The problem with this campaign is we've been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light,"" Moore said to a dwindling group of supporters Tuesday night. 

Alabama Republican Secretary of State John Merrill said on CNN that the race will be certified between Dec. 26 and Jan. 3, and he cast doubt on the idea that the margin could change substantially even after write-in votes are totaled and validated. 

Democrats were quick to point to the reversal by the RNC to renew support for Moore and indicated they would use it as fodder heading into the 2018 campaign.

""Today, in one of the most Republican states in the nation, the people of Alabama chose common decency and integrity over partisan politics,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said in a statement. ""Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee did the opposite, siding with a candidate who wanted to drag Alabama back to the days of George Wallace and faced a mountain of credible evidence that he had engaged in child sexual abuse. ... President Trump, Republican Senate candidates and the Republican National Committee showed us exactly who they are by standing with Roy Moore — and we will make sure voters do not forget it.""

Other national Republicans had been far less hospitable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he believes Moore's accusers and called on him to step aside, though he had softened his stance in recent weeks by saying the choice was up to Alabama voters. A Senate ethics investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Moore likely also would have followed had he won.

McConnell's allied superPAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, had spent heavily to support appointed Sen. Luther Strange in the primary, fearful that a Moore win would put the seat in jeopardy even before the sexual assault allegations against him surfaced. 

Trump had backed Strange then, too, but Steve Bannon — his former chief strategist who has since returned to lead Breitbart News — supported Moore and rallied with him in the closing days. Bannon had long touted Moore as part of the ""war"" he had promised to wage on the GOP establishment, backing challengers to sitting incumbents who would take on McConnell and support Trump's agenda. But other national strategists warned Bannon's civil war would cost them winnable seats — something that came to fruition on Tuesday night. 

""This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running,"" Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said in a statement. ""Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the President of the United States into his fiasco.""

National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is in charge of protecting the GOP's Senate majority in 2018, had withdrawn funding from Moore's campaign and at one point said he should be expelled from the Senate if he won. 

""Tonight's results are clear — the people of Alabama deemed Roy Moore unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate,"" Gardner said in a statement soon after Jones was declared the winner. ""I hope Senator-elect Doug Jones will do the right thing and truly represent Alabama by choosing to vote with the Senate Republican Majority.""

Even the state's senior GOP senator, Richard Shelby, had admitted he didn't vote for Moore, saying ""the Republican Party can do better"" and revealing he had instead written in another candidate. That may have pushed other on-the-fence Republicans to also write in a candidate, and that margin could have helped ultimately tip the race in Jones' favor.

Condoleezza Rice, a Birmingham native who served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush, cut a robocall in the race, not-so-subtly urging voters in her home state to ""reject bigotry, sexism and intolerance.""

In the end, Republicans recognize that they may be better off without having to deal with Moore in their caucus. 

""It may well be the best possible outcome. We don't have to apologize for Moore and Jones will win with less than 50% of the vote and will quickly fade into 2020,"" Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, told NPR.  ""This race wasn't about anybody other than Roy Moore and his past. To the extent there were bullets fired, they were by Roy Moore into his own feet."" 

Other Trump allies blamed McConnell for not working to help Moore. A headline on Breitbart News proclaimed that ""REPUBLICAN SABOTEURS FLIP SEAT TO DEMS."" 

""Trump is surrounded by strangers and political ignoramuses. They embarrassed the president tonight,"" said former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, blaming Trump's political advisers — including daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — for leading him astray in endorsing Strange in the first place and later waffling on Moore. 

Jones is a former U.S. attorney who is best known for prosecuting KKK members decades later for the killing of four young African-American girls in a 1963 Birmingham church bombing — a background that likely helped him spur a heavy black turnout that was critical for the Democrat to win. 

According to exit polls, African-American turnout reached almost 30 percent — comparable to what it was for Barack Obama in 2008. 

Over half of voters also said that the allegations against Moore were true, and 60 percent said the accusations were a factor in their vote. 

Jones also ran a far more visible race than Moore in the final stretch. He had outspent Moore almost 10-1 and had an active campaign schedule, while Moore had been largely absent from the campaign trail in the final stretch — including leaving the state over the weekend to attend the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia. Jones also had an active field operation, while the GOP nominee's staff was a skeleton crew.

Moore had remained defiant, however, using a very Trumpian strategy of running against the media and the D.C. establishment he says have conspired against him and are behind the allegations. And he won the GOP primary over the appointed Strange earlier this year, despite being heavily outspent by both Strange and the Senate Leadership Fund.

But even before the accusations of sexual assault surfaced, Moore was a controversial figure in Alabama politics who narrowly won election in the past and lost nominations for governor. He is a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice who was twice removed from the bench, the first time for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments he'd had erected in the state judiciary building. Later, he was re-elected to the court but then suspended after he directed state judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.

Moore's Christian nationalist positions are something that he hoped would resonate with many of the state's white evangelical voters, and he never backed off his controversial positions against same-sex marriage and transgender rights. He had hammered home his opposition to abortion rights, in contrast to Jones. Ultimately, however, it wouldn't be enough for Moore to overcome the damaging accusations against him.

"George Papadopoulos, who worked for President Trump's campaign as a foreign policy adviser, has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about meeting a professor with Russian ties who had promised to provide ""dirt"" on Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, 30, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, in an agreement that was unsealed on Monday after Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was taken into federal custody. Manafort was indicted along with his top deputy, Rick Gates, on charges ranging from conspiracy against the United States to conspiracy to launder money. News of all the charges was released by special counsel Robert Mueller's team at the Justice Department.

The guilty plea and accompanying documents are evidence of the earliest connection so far between Trump campaign officials and individuals close to the Russian government who sought to influence the 2016 election. The court papers are also the first official account of those ties to be provided by Mueller's investigative team; for months, news of such contacts had been attributed to anonymous sources in media reports.

On his LinkedIn page, Papadopoulos lists his credentials as an economic and political consultant, citing his work for both Trump and Ben Carson. He quotes Trump as saying about him, ""George is an oil and gas consultant; excellent guy.""

Court papers describe Papadopoulos using email to relay overtures from Russia's government inviting Trump to visit Moscow. In response, a figure in the Trump campaign identified only as ""High-Ranking Campaign Official"" referred Papadopoulos to another official because ""[h]e is running point.""

In a separate email thread, court papers say, one campaign official forwarded Papadopoulos' email to another, writing, ""Let[']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.""

After Papadopoulos said that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had widened its invitation to say that if Trump couldn't attend an ""off the record"" meeting another campaign representative might attend, a response came: A person identified as the Trump ""Campaign Supervisor"" eventually told Papadopoulos, ""I would encourage you"" to make the trip.

Despite that approval, the court documents note, the trip Papadopoulos proposed ""did not take place.""

The special counsel's office says Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about ""the timing, extent, and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials.""

Papadopoulos told the FBI that he had been in contact with the ""overseas professor"" before joining the Trump campaign — when in fact, he was already working with Trump, Mueller's Justice Department team says in court documents. The records also say that the professor ""only took interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign.""

Papadopoulos told agents that the professor had told him the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton, according to court documents. He met with the professor around March 14, after joining the Trump campaign, the Justice Department says. More than a month later, the professor told Papadopoulos that the damaging information was in the form of ""thousands of emails.""

That conversation took place ""on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant ... had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month,"" according to the Statement of Offense that was released Monday. As part of the plea deal, Papadopoulos signed papers certifying those statements as being fair and accurate.

Papadopoulos also described meeting a woman through the professor whom court documents describe as a ""female Russian national"" but whom Papadopoulos had referred to in an email as ""Putin's niece.""

In a footnote, the document adds, ""Defendant PAPADOPOULOS later learned that the Female Russian National was not in fact a relative of President Putin. In addition, while defendant PAPADOPOULOS expected that the Professor and the Female Russian National would introduce him to the Russian Ambassador in London, they never did.""

A timeline of the interactions between Papadopoulos and the Russian representatives are recounted in the Statement of Offense. Here's a selection of the entries:

Papadopoulos' role in the Trump campaign

Early March 2016: Papadopoulos learned he would be a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign. He lived in London at the time. On or about March 6, 2016, a supervisory campaign official (the ""Campaign Supervisor"") told Papadopoulos that a key foreign policy goal for the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.

Papadopoulos meets the professor and the female Russian national 

""On or about March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, [Papadopoulos] met an individual who was a professor based in London (the 'Professor'). Initially, the Professor seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos. However, after [Papadopoulos] informed the Professor about his joining the Campaign, the Professor appeared to take great interest in [Papadopoulos],"" court records state. The document adds that Papadopoulos hoped to use the professor's ""substantial connections with Russian government officials"" to boost his standing in the Trump campaign.

On or about March 24, 2016, Papadopoulos met with the professor in London and was introduced to a female Russian national. Afterward, Papadopoulos emailed the ""Campaign Supervisor"" and members of the Trump campaign's foreign policy team, saying he had talked with his ""good friend"" the professor and met a woman whom Papadopoulos called ""Putin's niece.""

Papadopoulos ""later learned that the Female Russian National was not in fact a relative of President Putin,"" the court document says.

Pursuing a meeting between the Trump campaign and Moscow

After he said that the Russians wanted ""to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump,"" Papadopoulos got a reply from the ""Campaign Supervisor"" in which he said he would ""work it through the campaign"" and to hold off on making any commitments. According to court records, the ""Campaign Supervisor"" added, ""Great work.""

On or about April 11, 2016: After Papadopoulos wrote to his contacts about ""a potential foreign policy trip to Russia,"" the female Russian national responded, "" I have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request. ... As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump. The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.""

On or about April 22, 2016: After an introduction to an individual with ties to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Papadopoulos discusses setting up a meeting in London. He later emails a senior Trump campaign policy adviser, ""The Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready []. The advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in ' neutral' cities.""

On or about April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos has a breakfast meeting with the professor, who tells him he met with high-level Russian officials in Moscow. The professor relays that the Russians have ""dirt"" on then-candidate Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later told the FBI, the professor said, ""[The Russians] have dirt on her""; ""the Russians had emails of Clinton""; ""they have thousands of emails.""

From mid-June through mid-August 2016, the documents state, Papadopoulos pursued an ""off the record"" meeting between one or more campaign representatives and ""members of president putin's office and the mfa [Ministry of Foreign Affairs].""

After several weeks of further communications regarding a potential ""off the record"" meeting with Russian officials, on or about Aug. 15, 2016: the ""Campaign Supervisor"" told Papadopoulos, according to court records, "" 'I would encourage you' and another foreign policy advisor to the Campaign to 'make the trip[], if it is feasible.' ""

Despite those weeks of emails and other communications, the trip did not take place.

The charge against Papadopoulos carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. In the plea deal, the government agrees to reduce its sentencing recommendation under federal sentencing guidelines, dropping from a 6 to a 4 on its scale of base offense levels. It will be up to a court to determine the severity of Papadopoulos' punishment.

"When Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer last June, did he break any U.S. laws?

That question hung over Washington on Tuesday after President Trump's son released an email exchange about the meeting. The emails appear to confirm he was enthusiastic about an offer of foreign help to attack his father's political opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

The problem is that a federal law says foreign nationals cannot ""directly or indirectly"" give a ""thing of value"" to American political campaigns. Moreover, the law says no one is allowed to ""solicit, accept, or receive"" any thing of value from a foreign national to help a candidate.

Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan Futerfas says ""Don Jr. did nothing wrong,"" but Robert Bauer, a Democratic campaign finance lawyer, says the law is not on Trump Jr.'s side.

""This is a case where a campaign may have been openly courting support from a foreign national in trying win an election. And that is squarely prohibited by the federal campaign finance laws,"" Bauer said.

The emails at issue were exchanged last June between Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone, a longtime associate.

Goldstone offered to serve as an intermediary who could connect Trump Jr. with a Russian official who had information ""that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] ... and would be very useful to your father.""

Trump Jr. responded by saying, ""If it's what you say [then] I love it especially later in the summer.""

Trump Jr. then not only agreed to the meeting, but also looped in his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and the former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The three of them met with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016.

Velenitskaya appeared on NBC News on Tuesday morning, saying she actually had wanted to discuss U.S.-Russian adoption policies, and had no political opposition research to offer the three Americans who came to see her. She added: ""It's quite possible they were looking for such information. They wanted it so badly.""

So the meeting happened in early June, and then the following month, hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee appeared online. Democrats accused the Trump campaign of colluding with the Russian hackers to get those records.

Trump Jr. went on CNN in late July to dismiss the idea that the Trump campaign would do such a thing. ""I mean, I can't think of bigger lies — but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win,"" he said.

And the candidate himself, Donald Trump, wondered aloud whether Russian hackers could dig up emails from Clinton's server.

""Russia, if you are listening: I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said.

Bauer said that Trump Jr.'s email exchange with Goldstone confirms that the Trump campaign was actively trying to get help from Russians. And he notes that foreign nationals don't get First Amendment free-speech rights in U.S. elections, so the law's prohibitions on such help are very strict.

After Trump Jr.'s surprising release of his email exchange, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a statement from President Trump: ""My son is a high-quality person, and I applaud his transparency.""
